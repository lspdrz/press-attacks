The statements by Yemen Youth TV and the journalists' families say that Qabil and al-Ayzri were in a car with a third man, Hussein al-Aysi, when they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Houthis. The families' statement also says the Houthi militiamen searched the journalists' car and confiscated their equipment before capturing and imprisoning them.\nQabil's body was recovered on May 25, and al-Ayzari's the next day, according to news reports.

Belqees TV, Yemen Youth TV, and Suhail TV released statements blaming the Houthis for the deaths of the two reporters and alleging that the Houthis used the journalists as human shields to protect a military installation. After the strike, the head of the earthquake monitoring station told the media that there was no military value to the site, according to news reports.\nHouthi rebels took control of the capital, Sana'a, and other cities in September 2014, eventually forcing the government to resign, according to news reports. On March 25, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of 10 countries began launching air strikes, targeting territory controlled by the Houthi militia, in an attempt to restore the exiled president who fled Yemen later that month as the Houthis increased their control over the country. Around the time that the air strikes began, outlets critical of the Houthis or affiliated with coalition governments were raided by Houthi forces and their staff temporarily detained, according to CPJ research.\nBoth Qabil and Belqees TV were attacked by Houthi militiamen in prior months. Two different posts on Qabil's Facebook page said he was the victim of a kidnapping attempt by the Houthis in late February 2015.

Both are published in Avar, the language of the largest ethnic group in the volatile, multiethnic southern republic of Dagestan.\nZulfiya Gadzhiyeva, a Hakikat colleague, told CPJ that the editor sharply criticized federal and local officials for suppressing religious and political dissent under the guise of an \"anti-extremism\" campaign. In Sogratl, Akhmedilov called on regional authorities to investigate the 2008 police killing of a Sogratl resident whom law enforcement agents said was a guerrilla fighter. The journalist was also known for his investigative reporting into the recent assassinations of Dagestani officials, the Russian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.\nGadzhiyeva, who visited the crime scene and met with Akhmedilov's wife and neighbors, said witnesses saw at least one killer in a parked Lada sedan with tinted windows and no license plates in the editor's neighborhood. When the journalist left in his car for an errand, the Lada followed and at least one gunman fired, she told CPJ.\nAkhmedilov's neighbors said they had seen the same Lada parked in the neighborhood for at least two days prior to the killing, Gadzhiyeva told CPJ. Akhmedilov did not report receiving any threats, she said.\nThe Dagestan Investigative Committee, the region's top investigative office, opened a probe into the murder, the agency reported on its Web site. News reports said investigators initially focused on the journalist's private life rather than his journalism.\nOn May 30, 2016, a district court in Makhachkala sentenced two local men, Murad Shuaibov and Isa Abdurakhmanov, to 10 years and six months and 8 years in jail, respectively, in connection to Akhmedilov's murder, Kavkazsky Uzel reported. According to Kavkazsky Uzel, the court found that Shuaibov shot the journalist because Akhmedilov distributed leaflets in which he said that Shuaibov was a follower of Wahhabism. The court found that Abdurakhmanov was an accomplice, for driving the getaway car. According to news reports, both men protested the accusations, declared that investigators failed to provide substantial evidence, and refused to testify. No mastermind was identified or brought to justice.\nAli Kamalov, head of the Dagestan branch of Russian Union of Journalists, told Kavkazsky Uzel that investigators know who ordered Akhmedilov's murder but are afraid of bringing them to justice.\nAccording to Kavkazsky Uzel, authorities detained both men in early 2013, and their trial began in December of that year. In March 2015 a local court convicted and sentenced them in connection to Akhmedilov's murder, but four months later, Dagestan's Supreme Court overturned the verdict on appeal based on procedural violations in the trial, reports said. The second trial, which ended with May 30 convictions, started in September 2015, Kavkazsky Uzel reported."},{"id":64,"location":"Iraq","year":"2007","name":"Abdulrazak Hashim Ayal al-Khakani","organization":"Jumhuriyat al-iraq","date":"February 5, 2007","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Baghdad","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Editor","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"Yes","threatened":"No","description":"Iraqi police discovered the body of al-Khakani, 45, an editor and news presenter at Jumhuriyat al-Iraq radio, and that of his cousin, in Baghdad's western neighborhood of Al-Jihad.

Mohamed Saleh, a member of the pro-opposition Hama Media Center, confirmed Abu al-Hamza was filming for SMART, adding that he also worked for the media center.\n\nSaleh said he was accompanying Abu al-Hamza, Mustafa Abu Arab, who is also part of the Hama Media Center, and Ali Abu Farouk, a correspondent for the local pro-opposition Step News Agency, on the day Abu al-Hamza was killed. Pictures posted by the journalists show the four of them riding motorcycles and carrying their cameras on their way to Tel Sukayk. Abu al-Hamza appears in the pictures in jeans, black shirt, and brown jacket, camera in hand.\n\nOnce reaching the hilltop, Abu Farouk began interviewing an opposition fighter for Step News Agency. Saleh told CPJ the fighter was a member of Ajnad al-Sham, a group fighting as part of the broad Islamist coalition, Jaish al-Fateh.\n\nIn a graphic video posted by Abu Arab to his YouTube page the following day, the same Ajnad al-Sham fighter is seen speaking to Abu al-Hamza about the offense as the faint sound of a mortar firing can be heard in the distance. As the fighter looks up, a mortar shell hits in front of the camera. The camera was propelled to the ground by the blast but continued to record the sound of those who had been injured.\n\nThe journalist's colleagues told CPJ Abu al-Hamza and the Ajnad al-Sham fighter were killed. Saleh, Abu Arab, and Abu Farouk were injured in the explosion and an Ajnad al-Sham fighter needed his hand amputated, Saleh said.\n\nThe SMART News correspondent Hoeesh told CPJ that Abu al-Hamza joined the agency two months earlier and was still in his probationary period when he died.\n\nDuring his probationary period with SMART, Abu al-Hamza posted numerous SMART videos to his Facebook page, which he claimed to have filmed in the Hama countryside and which showed opposition forces fighting or government aircraft bombing. SMART News Agency typically does not add bylines to its videos. In the week before his death, the agency published several photos under his byline of opposition forces shelling government positions and ruins in the wake of government bombing.\n\nBoth Saleh and Hoeesh told CPJ Abu al-Hamza also worked for the media office of a local branch of Ahrar al-Sham, another rebel group belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Abu al-Hamza's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front.\n\nSaleh, who also was a member of the Ahrar al-Sham's local media office until he quit after Abu al-Hamza's death, said that Abu al-Hamza joined the group as a fighter but became involved only in media work nearly two years ago. Saleh explained how a crew from the media office would join fighters on the battlefield, each of them focusing on filming different kinds of weaponry to get the full picture of the battle.\n\nAbu al-Hamza's Facebook shows his apparent support for Ahrar al-Sham, with his banner picture featuring the group's logo and frequent posts about the group's fighters and leaders who had been killed. In what appear to be posts related to his role as part of the group's media office, he shared pictures and messages of support for fighters. In May 2015, he posted a picture of what he said were two Ahrar al-Sham fighters detaining a \"supporter of the Assad gangs.\" A few days later, he posted a picture purportedly distributed by Islamic State of the heads of beheaded opposition fighters in a truck bed.

Al-Shaibani, who is not wearing clothing identifying him as a journalist, can be seen running, clutching a satchel, when he suddenly falls to the ground with a gunshot wound to the head. Later, two men in military clothing attempt to pull al-Shaibani off the street, but they also come under fire.\nResidents of Taiz have endured a months-long siege as a patchwork of pro-government and Islamist groups resist attempts to take the city by fighters belonging to Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthis, and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. A month before al-Shaibani's death, a crew working for Al-Jazeera in the city were abducted for several days by unknown gunmen before being released.\nAhmed al-Basha, a Yemeni photographer who contributes to Agence France-Presse, told CPJ that he, al-Shaibani and a group of other journalists had gone to Al-Hasab neighborhood of western Taiz to report on a fire in a plastics factory that had been hit by a shell believed to be from pro-Houthi fighters. Al-Basha stayed behind with some of the journalists, as others, including al-Shaibani, left the factory site. As al-Basha returned from the factory, he photographed a puddle of blood in the street shown in the Yemen Shabab video, only to find out later the blood was al-Shaibani's. \nAl-Basha told CPJ that what he believed to be pro-Houthi gunmen purposefully targeted the journalists, saying that he too had come under fire crossing that street as he returned from the factory. In a report filed two days before the killing, Sky News Arabic correspondent Mohammed al-Qadhi said that Houthi forces had deployed snipers on the street.\nAl-Basha told CPJ that all the journalists who went to the factory had to cross the same street, including another Yemen TV journalist, Ahmed al-Bokari. Al-Bokari wrote on his Facebook page that he crossed the street first and was waiting on the other side as al-Shaibani attempted to cross. After al-Shaibani was hit, two anti-Houthi fighters were able to retrieve him under fire and transport him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nAl-Shaibani's most recent reports for the website Yaman News were about the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Taiz and attempts to distribute humanitarian assistance.\nThe administrator of the general email account for Yemen TV, who did not identify himself by name, told CPJ in an email that al-Shaibani was on his first assignment for the station the day he was killed. After Houthi forces took control of the capital of Sanaa in September 2014, they commandeered government institutions, including Yemen TV and other state media outlets. Yemen's internationally recognized government in exile in 2015 set up a rival station, also named Yemen TV, for which al-Shaibani worked, according to news reports.

In a picture CPJ has viewed of al-Mousa's body, which his family sent to al-Hamza, bandages can be seen around the journalist's head and neck.\nAl-Mousa's murder came amid a campaign of violence by the Islamic State militant group against members of RBSS and other Syrian journalists. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the murders of at least two RBSS members. In October 2015, Ibrahim Abd al-Qader was killed alongside fellow journalist Fares Hamadi in Urfa, southeastern Turkey. In May 2014, Al-Moutaz Bellah Ibrahim was kidnapped and murdered by the militants.\nSome supporters of Islamic State claimed on Twitter after al-Mousa's murder that their \"soldiers\" killed him, and referred to him as an \"apostate\" and \"agent of crusaders.\" In a video published online on March 8, 2016 by Islamic State's local branch in Deir Ezzor, Syria, the militant group claimed responsibility for the murders of all four journalists. The video, \"Escaping won't do you any good,\" shows two new hostages who identify themselves as Mohamed al-Kardoush and Jamal al-Ati, whom the militants accuse of providing information to Western governments. It was not immediately clear if the hostages are journalists.\nAl-Mousa was also named in a video released by Islamic State on January 3, 2016 showing the murder of five men. In the 10-minute video the men say they covertly filmed Islamic State activity and opened an Internet café to share material with news outlets and Turkey-based activists, including al-Mousa. Al-Hamza denied any of the hostages worked with RBSS. Western intelligence agencies are investigating the authenticity of the video, according to news reports.\nThe Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate that controls Idlib, told al-Hamza it is investigating al-Mousa's death.\nAccording to al-Hamza, al-Mousa edited and vetted reports for RBSS from Raqqa out of Gaziantep in Turkey and Idlib in Syria. He went into hiding in Idlib several months before his death, after Islamic State kidnapped his father and released a video of his murder in August 2015. One week after al-Mousa's murder, Islamic State claimed to have killed the journalist's aunt, Maria Hasan al-Shams, al-Hamza said. She was taken captive in October after militants found a picture on her phone of Hamoud al-Mousa, who is the brother of the dead journalist and one of RBSS's co-founders, al-Hamza told CPJ.\nSince April 2014, RBSS has documented the abuses of Islamic State in Raqqa.

The laser pen tactic had been used by Muslim Brotherhood supporters and police during protests to identify activists for harassment or attack, according to news accounts. \nEarlier in the day, Abou Deif had shot video showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters assaulting anti-government protesters, a colleague, Hossam Sioufi, told CPJ. (A number of reporters and others later published videos showing Muslim Brotherhood supporters beating, intimidating, and detaining protesters that day.) Abou Deif was himself struck by a rubber bullet, suffering minor injuries, earlier in the day. \nAbou Deif's family and colleagues told CPJ they believed the journalist was likely targeted by the Muslim Brotherhood, and that one of his recent articles may have provided further motive. Four months earlier, Abou Deif had written a piece that said President Mohamed Morsi had included a brother-in-law in a mass July 2012 presidential pardon that encompassed 572 people. Morsi's brother-in-law, Mahmoud Aly, had been serving a three-year sentence on a bribery conviction. Morsi didn't publicly respond to About Deif's report. Soon after, Abou Deif told his brother, Salem, and several colleagues that he was being followed on the streets and was receiving threats on his Facebook page from people he identified as Muslim Brotherhood supporters, according to CPJ interviews.\nThe subsequent investigation and the government's response were marked by irregularities. In January 2013, Morsi spokesman Yassir Ali disputed any Muslim Brotherhood connection to the killing. In a letter to the Washington Post, he said \"forensic reports confirmed that Abu Deif was killed by the same type of bullet that killed seven pro-Morsi protesters at the same demonstrations.\"\nBut the government's forensic report had not been issued at that point. It was released more than a month later, in February 2013, and was notable for what it did not include. The Forensics Administration said it had not received an investigative memorandum from police, a key document that would typically include witness testimony and other details from the scene. The memorandum, which investigators are normally obligated to file in such cases, would ordinarily be used by the Forensics Administration to help determine the source and distance of the shot and other salient circumstances that would guide the prosecutor in pursuing charges. As it was, the report referred only vaguely to the distance at which the shot was fired, saying it came from \"more than a meter\" away,\" and did not specify the type of weapon or bullet used, although it described the slug as having expanded after entering Abou Deif's skull.\nStatements from witnesses such as Shahin and pressure from the Egyptian Journalists' Syndicate prompted authorities in April 2013 to summon three Muslim Brotherhood youth leaders for six hours of questioning. The accused were released for lack of evidence. The suspects were publicly identified as Ahmed Sibia, Abdel Rahman Ezz, and Ahmed al-Moghier. Sibia was also the director of Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa television office in Cairo. The three denied involvement in the killing and said their own lives had been threatened by opposition activists, according to news reports.\nThe same month, Abou Deif's family hired Fakhry Saleh, former head of the Forensics Administration, to conduct its own investigation. Saleh, using the official medical report and eyewitness testimony, concluded that a gunman fired one shot at close range using a \"dumdum\" bullet designed to expand on impact to intensify the injury.\nThe public prosecutor's office reopened the investigation in late May--only to close the case a month later with the vague explanation that it could not identify the \"original killer.\" The office referred al-Moghier for trial on charges of torturing and detaining opposition protesters during the same clashes in which Abou Deif was killed. \nAfter Morsi's ouster in July 2013, the prosecutor general's office asked a Cairo judge to examine the case independently, a step that encouraged Abou Deif's family and lawyers."},{"id":136,"location":"Syria","year":"2014","name":"Al-Moutaz Bellah Ibrahim","organization":"Shaam news network","date":"May 4, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Raqqa","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio, Television","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Ibrahim, a correspondent for the independent Shaam News Network and a freelance reporter, was killed in Tel Abyad, a Syrian town north of the city of Raqqa, on May 4, according to Shaam and the Beirut-based SKeyes Center for Media and Cultural Freedom.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":158,"location":"Mexico","year":"2008","name":"Alejandro Zenón Fonseca Estrada","organization":"Exa fm","date":"September 24, 2008","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Villahermosa","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"On the\nevening of September 23, 2008, four unidentified men in a van shot Fonseca as\nhe hung anti-crime posters on a major street in the capital city of Villahermosa, in the southern Gulf coast state of Tabasco, according to\nwitnesses and local police.

Exiled opposition activist Shakhida Yakub, who was close to Saipov, told The Associated Press that the journalist had recently become politically involved with Uzbek opposition groups.\nAn ethnic Uzbek, Saipov lived in and reported from the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, just across the border from the Uzbek city of Andijan. Saipov covered the aftermath of mass killings in Andijan in May 2005, when government troops shot at crowds of civilians protesting President Islam Karimov's regime. He reported on Uzbek refugees who fled and resettled in Kyrgyzstan. The Uzbek government put the Andijan death toll at 187; human rights groups say more than 700 were killed.\nPrior to his murder, Saipov had received anonymous threats warning him to stop his press and political activities, a local source close to the journalist told CPJ. A state television channel in the Uzbek city of Namangan had recently aired a program smearing Saipov as a provocateur who tried to destabilize Uzbekistan with his reporting. Several state publications ran similar articles, the same source told CPJ.\nFollowing the Andijan killings, Uzbekistan moved aggressively to expel, drive into exile, imprison, and harass independent journalists, human rights defenders, opposition activists, representatives of international nongovernmental groups, and witnesses. Many found refuge in neighboring Kyrgyzstan, but Uzbek security services infiltrated the area and continued harassing them there, according to human rights groups. Local press reports said that Uzbek security agents had been spotted in the heavily ethnic-Uzbek city of Osh.\nSaipov had helped scores of Uzbek refugees in southern Kyryzstan, assisting them with lodging and linking them with resettlement agencies, AP said. He had also reported on the fate of Uzbek refugees in Iran for Ferghana, the news site said."},{"id":200,"location":"USA","year":"2015","name":"Alison Parker","organization":"Wdbj7","date":"August 26, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Dangerous Assignment","specificlocation":"Smith Mountain Lake","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"Business, Corruption, Crime, Culture, Human Rights, Politics, Sports","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Local Residents","description":"Parker, 24, a reporter for local TV station WDBJ7, was shot dead alongside Adam Ward, 27, a cameraman for the station, at around 6:45 a.m. during a live broadcast at the Bridgewater Plaza shopping mall in Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia, according to press reports. The gunman, identified by police as Vester Lee Flanagan II, but also known as Bryce Williams, shot Parker and Ward while recording on his own video camera, according to The New York Times.\nParker was reporting on the 50th anniversary of Smith Mountain Lake, a reservoir in the Roanoke region of Virginia that offers recreational activities. Parker and Ward were standing on a balcony at the mall interviewing Vicki Gardner, executive director of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, when Flanagan fired repeatedly, killing Parker and Ward, reports said. Gardner was wounded in the attack, according to the BBC.\nWhile being pursued by police Flanagan wrote about the shooting on his Twitter account and uploaded the video of the shooting to his Facebook page, NBC News reported. A manifesto that ABC News said was sent to them from Flanagan spoke positively of mass murderers and said that as a black, gay man he had faced discrimination and sexual harassment.\nFlanagan shot himself hours later after being cornered by the police on a highway and died at a local hospital a few hours later, according to press reports.\nFlanagan had been dismissed from his role as a reporter at the station in February 2013 and had a history of conflict at work and rage allegedly fueled by racial grievances, according to CNN. He claimed staff mistreated him during his time there, according to press reports. According to the notice of termination, the station said Flanagan was dismissed for \"unsatisfactory job performance and inability to work as a team member,\" The Guardian reported.\nThe video recording, which appeared to be taken by a body camera worn by the gunman, showed Flanagan waiting until Parker and Ward had started a live broadcast, before firing. The New York Times said his actions guaranteed the shooting would be seen, live or recorded, by thousands of viewers.\nABC News headquarters in New York City reported that two hours after the shooting a 23-page manifesto, allegedly from Flanagan, was faxed to them. The declaration pointed to a June 17, 2015 shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, in which a white supremacist is accused of murdering nine black people in a Bible study group.

The assailants claimed they had a warrant for the reporter's arrest, pointed weapons at family members, then forced Flores Salazar into one of three gray trucks outside, Luz Salazar said.\n\"We pleaded with them not to take her. I told them that she had recently had a baby,\" she said.\nFlores Salazar, who covered local crime and police activities, had a new baby and a four-year-old son, according to news reports.\nOn the day of the abduction, the attorney general's office released a statement saying that they were investigating the case. The statement said that in August 2014 Flores Salazar had been in the company of an alleged member of an organized crime group at the time of his arrest, but did not provide further details.\nWhen CPJ asked Luz Salazar about that aspect of the attorney general's public statement, she said her niece had been having dinner with her family when police arrested the suspected criminal, who was at the same restaurant but not with them.\nThe day after the statement was released, 43 journalists from central Mexico and the state of Veracruz wrote an open letter in which they urged the state government to \"stop criminalizing murdered journalists.\" CPJ has documented several cases in which Veracruz authorities have made unfounded accusations linking murdered journalists to criminals.\nJosé Martínez Sánchez, a spokesperson from the Veracruz Attorney General's office, told CPJ authorities have not discarded any lines of investigation, but could not comment on specific details of the case.\nOn February 13, the governor of Veracruz, Javier Duarte Ochoa, alleged in a tweet that Josele Márquez Balderas, who is imprisoned and has been linked to the Zetas drug cartel, had ordered the killing of Flores Salazar.

News reports also described Flores Salazar as a former contributor to the daily newspapers El Buen Tono and El Mundo de Orizaba.\nFlores Salazar's former employer, El Buen Tono, has distanced itself from the case. In a radio interviewed cited in local media, the owner of El Buen Tono, José Abella, alleged that Flores Salazar had been fired from the magazine eight months earlier because she owned a car that did not correspond with her income. Abella claimed that this was a sign of her involvement with organized crime.\nOther journalists from the area have called Abella's claim into question, casting doubts about his knowledge of the case and raising concerns about his alleged links to the Veracruz government, according to press reports. Morales told CPJ that El Buen Tono generally took a pro-government editorial line.\n\"She was not a criminal,\" said Morales, who knew Flores Salazar but did not work closely with her. He told CPJ that local journalists know which of their colleagues are involved in organized crime. Morales said that he and his colleagues had never heard of Flores Salazar's being linked to criminal groups. \nBut Morales also raised doubts about Flores Salazar's journalism being the motive for her murder. Morales said that Flores Salazar did not write the type of stories that were likely to cause retribution. \"She mostly covered accidents and crashes,\" he told CPJ.\nOn May 4, the Veracruz attorney general's office released a statement announcing the arrest of an individual it identified only as \"G.P.V.\", who, the office alleged, was involved in the murder.

The article, which was later removed from Komsomolskaya Pravda’swebsite but was available in Google cache, said the two journalists found a car, similar to the one in which Stenin was last seen, that had been burned and had three charred bodies inside with professional photo equipment in the trunk. The two reported that the car was found in a field near the town of Snizhne. \nOn September 3, Russian authorities and news outlets reported that Stenin had been killed in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine the day after he went missing. \nIn a statement released the same day, Russia’s Investigative Committee said Stenin was killed on August 6 during what they said was a Ukrainian army attack on a column of cars carrying refugees from the east and guarded by a group of pro-Russia separatists. The authorities did not support their allegations with any evidence, and did not say how they determined the source of fire or the date of Stenin’s death. The statement said DNA tests had confirmed that the body inside the car was Stenin’s. Investigators for the committee said separatists gave the photojournalist’s remains to Russian authorities on August 27. \nThe other two victims were not immediately identified.\nThe Investigative Committee and Rossiya Segodnya accused Ukrainian paratroopers with the 79th airborne brigade of killing Stenin during the alleged attack in August.

Gerashchenko later retracted his statement, telling Rossiya Segodnya that his words had been taken out of context.\nIn a statement, reported by Rossiya Segodnya, Gerashchenko said on September 3 that Ukrainian authorities did not have access to the separatist-controlled region where Stenin was believed to have been killed, and so were unable to conduct an investigation. “We cannot conduct a probe without access to the body,” Gerashchenko said."},{"id":240,"location":"Philippines","year":"2006","name":"Andres Acosta","organization":"Dzjc","date":"December 20, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Batac","freelance":"No","description":"An unidentified attacker stabbed commentator Acosta in the town of Batac, 240 miles (390 kilometers) north of Manila.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":242,"location":"Russia","year":"1995","name":"Andrew Shumack","organization":"Freelancer","date":"July 28, 1995","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"an unknown place","freelance":"Yes","description":"Shumack, an American freelance journalist, was last seen on July 28, 1995 when he left the Chechen capital, Grozny, and headed toward the surrounding mountainous area.

She said that the program had run for more than a decade and was one of the most popular and trusted news programs in the city.The radio reporter and Sandoval said separately that they had never heard Gahona mention any threats against him in their years of working together, but that local journalists were concerned about potential violence amid the escalating protests.Nicaraguan authorities on May 7, 2018, arrested two alleged suspects in the killing and charged them with murder, attempted murder, and other crimes, according to a press release from the public prosecutor’s office. A judge ordered preventive detention for both of them in the capital of Managua prior to their first hearing, scheduled for May 18, according to news reports.

The Interfax news agency, citing police, said Politkovskaya had been shot and that a pistol and four bullet casings had been found.\nPolitkovskaya, special correspondent for the independent Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was well known for her investigative reports on human rights abuses by the Russian military in Chechnya. In seven years covering the second Chechen war, Politkovskaya's reporting repeatedly drew the wrath of Russian authorities. She was threatened, jailed, forced into exile, and poisoned during her career, CPJ research shows.\nIgor Korolkov, a colleague, told the Regnum news website that Politkovskaya had been reporting on alleged torture in Chechnya.\nCPJ had named Politkovskaya one of the world's top press freedom figures of the past 25 years in the fall 2006 edition of its magazine, Dangerous Assignments. In an interview for that profile, Politkovskaya noted the government's obstruction and harassment of journalists trying to cover the Chechen conflict and pointed to the deadly 2004 hostage crisis in the North Ossetian town of Beslan. \"There is so much more to write about Beslan,\" she told CPJ, \"but it gets more and more difficult when all the journalists who write are forced to leave.\"\nPolitkovskaya was poisoned on her way to cover the Beslan crisis. After drinking tea on a flight to the region, she became seriously ill and was hospitalized--but the toxin was never identified because the medical staff was instructed to destroy her blood tests.\nPolitkovskaya had been threatened and attacked numerous times in retaliation for her work. In February 2001, CPJ research shows, security agents detained her in the Vedeno district in Chechnya, accusing her of entering Chechnya without accreditation. She was kept in a pit for three days without food or water, while a military officer threatened to shoot her. Seven months later, she received death threats from a military officer accused of crimes against civilians. She was forced to flee to Vienna after the officer sent an e-mail to Novaya Gazeta promising that he would seek revenge.\nWhen Politkovskaya covertly visited Chechnya in 2002 to investigate new allegations of human rights abuses, CPJ research shows, security officers arrested her, kept her overnight at a military base, and threatened her. In October of that year, Politkovskaya served as a mediator between armed Chechen fighters and Russian forces during a hostage standoff in a central Moscow theater. Two days into the crisis, with the Kremlin restricting media coverage, Russian forces gassed the theater and 129 hostages died. Politkovskaya delivered some of the most compelling accounts of the tragedy.\nIn 2009, a Moscow jury acquitted three suspected conspirators, the brothers Ibragim and Dzhabrail Makhmudov and former Moscow police officer Sergei Khadzhikurbanov. Another Makhmudov brother, Rustam, whom authorities identified as the gunman, was at large at the time. Investigators acknowledged they had rushed a poorly prepared case to trial. An appellate court later granted a re-trial.\nThe case moved forward again in 2012, when prosecutors indicted Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov, a retired police lieutenant colonel, on charges that he helped orchestrate the murder. Authorities accused Pavlyuchenkov, head of surveillance for Moscow's main police force in 2006, of ordering subordinates to follow Politkovskaya and determine her schedule and usual travel routes. The information was then passed along to the gang hired to kill the journalist, prosecutors said.\nIn December 2012, Pavlyuchenkov was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges that he was an accomplice in the plot. Family and colleagues were dismayed by the ruling, which came after a closed proceeding; lawyers for Politkovskaya's family said they would appeal. Colleagues and relatives had hoped Pavlyuchenkov would identify the masterminds in open court.\nFollowing the verdict, investigators said they considered exiled tycoon Boris Berezovsky and Chechen envoy Akhmed Zakayev to be the masterminds--an assertion dismissed by Politkovskaya's representatives as unfounded and politically motivated.\nFive other suspects were in detention in late 2012, including all three Makhmudov brothers, former officer Khadzhikurbanov, and Chechen underground leader Lom-Ali Gaitukayev. Prosecutors said Gaitukayev served as the main organizer and liaison between the masterminds and Pavlyuchenkov.\nOn May 20, 2014, a Moscow City Court jury found the five defendants guilty of planning, participating, and carrying out Politkovskaya's murder, local and international press reported. On July 9, 2014, the court sentenced Rustam Makhmudov, the convicted gunman, and Gaitukayev, the organizer of the crime, to life terms in prison. Two other Makhmudov brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, convicted as the gunman's driver and lookout, received 14- and 12-year jail terms, respectively. Convicted as an accomplice to the murder, Khadzhikurbanov received 20 years in prison. No one was tried as the suspected mastermind.\nAnna Stavitskaya, lawyer for Politkovskaya's adult children, told CPJ, \"My clients, Ilya and Vera Politkovsky, are convinced that the men sentenced indeed bear responsibility in the murder. But they are also convinced that the crime is far from being fully solved.\" Frustrated with the course of the investigation, the journalist's family applied to the European Court of Human Rights, which could intervene if it concluded local authorities did not carry out a proper inquiry.\nOn June 24, 2014, the Moscow City Court said it would hear Pavlyuchenkov's appeal to postpone the start of his prison term because of alleged health problems, including mental health issues. (Pavlyuchenkov was being held in a detention facility pending appeals.) A court scheduled a hearing for his case on August 18, 2014.\nStavitskaya told the Russian service of the U.S.-funded Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that the family believed there were no grounds for postponing Pavlyuchenkov's sentence. \"There are many people who appeal for release or postponement of their terms in connection with their health conditions,\" she said. \"But their appeals are routinely rejected by the courts, even though oftentimes the crimes they are convicted of are of economic nature. Pavlyuchenkov was convicted of murder. He admitted his guilt and has been under arrest for a long time now. There are no reasons to believe that he cannot continue to be under arrest.\"\nPolitkovskaya's former colleagues at Novaya Gazeta said Pavlyuchenkov knew much more about the murder than he had revealed. They said the investigating authorities were aware of this but had not pressed him to speak. They said the official investigation was lacking in other ways as well: They said it had become clear a number of officers with the police's elite secret department and the Federal Security Service (FSB) played roles in the murder, but none of the officers were brought to justice.\nKarinna Moskalenko, one of the Politkovskaya family lawyers, said she was skeptical about the 2014 verdicts and sentencing. \"The life terms given to two secondary culprits in the murder,\" Moskalenko told CPJ, \"are an attempt to avert the international attention away from the case, and from the fact that Anna Politkovskaya's killing remains unsolved.\""},{"id":250,"location":"Somalia","year":"1993","name":"Anthony Macharia","organization":"Reuters","date":"July 12, 1993","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Mogadishu","job":"Technician","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Mob Violence","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Macharia, a Kenyan soundman working for Reuters; Hansi Krauss, a German photographer with the Associated Press; Hosea Maina, a\nKenyan photographer working for Reuters; and Dan Eldon, photographer holding\nBritish and American passports and working for Reuters, were killed when a crowd, angered\nby a the death of more than 70 Somalis in an aerial attack on General\nMohamed Farah Aidid's command post, set upon them wielding rocks,\nclubs, and guns.

Georgian forensic experts found that the journalist had died at approximately 2 a.m. on the morning of October 16.When police found Russo's body some 14 hours later, they also recovered a rope that had evidently been taken from the journalist's apartment and then used to tie him up. According to press reports, the apartment had been searched and looted; Russo's laptop computer, mobile telephone, video camera, and three videotapes were missing.Georgian authorities did not rule out the theory that Russo had been killed because of his journalism. At least one official suggested that an unnamed \"foreign intelligence service\" played a role in his death, implying that Russian authorities were unhappy about Russo's frequent contacts with Chechen rebel forces. According to some reports, he planned to return to Italy at the end of October with video footage that allegedly showed Russian forces in Chechnya using weapons that violated international humanitarian conventions.However, these accusations may simply reflect animosity between Russia and Georgia over the latter's alleged support for the Chechens.

He was shot four times in the head and his body showed signs of abuse, the local press said.\nSaldaña, 52, worked for the radio station La Ke Buena 100.9 FM in the town of Tierra Blanca, in Veracruz state. Octavio Bravo Bravo, Saldaña's colleague at the station, told CPJ that he last saw the journalist on May 2 in Veracruz. The local newspaper Crónica de Tierra Blanca reported that Saldaña disappeared after a party that day. Another report by El Mundo said that Saldaña was intercepted by gunmen as he headed home.\nIn the days leading up to his death, Saldaña, who hosted a Saturday news show, reported on the alleged theft by organized crime members of petroleum products from pipelines belonging to Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, the state oil company, Bravo Bravo told CPJ. Theft from pipelines plagues Pemex and often involves organized crime and cartels such as Los Zetas.\nOrganized crime, Bravo Bravo said, is rife in the Tierra Blanca region and is a topic on which journalists tend to stay silent, offering only basic details and not naming names. Saldaña pushed the envelope further than most, Bravo Bravo said. \"Among ourselves, we self-censor. You put your life at risk and that of your family, too,\" he said. \"I knew him as an earnest person: hard working, serious, responsible, very professional and competent. I don't know what happened.\"\nOaxaca officials said they were investigating the murder, according to news reports. On May 22, authorities announced they had captured suspect Juan Carlos de la Cruz Vergara. The suspect was formally charged on May 27 of participating in the murder, but authorities didn't offer any further details or a possible motive, according to news reports. The victim's daughter, Cristina Saldaña, told reporters she was disappointed that Veracruz authorities had not sought to take jurisdiction of the case because Saldaña lived in Veracruz and was likely kidnapped in that state.\nInvestigating thefts from pipelines has been dangerous for journalists in Mexico in the past, according to CPJ research. In August 2014, freelance journalist Octavio Rojas Hernández, who worked for two months for the Veracruz newspaper El Buen Tono, was shot dead two days after El Buen Tono had published a story on the army and Oaxaca state police breaking up a local ring accused of siphoning gas from pipelines belonging to Pemex."},{"id":269,"location":"Philippines","year":"2004","name":"Arnnel Manalo","organization":"Bulgar and dzrh radio","date":"August 5, 2004","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Bauan","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Print Reporter","medium":"Print, Radio","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Gunmen ambushed and killed Manalo, 42, a correspondent for the Manila \ntabloid Bulgar and radio station DZRH, in the morning, shortly \nafter he dropped off his children at school, according to international \nnews reports and local journalists. \nTwo men on a motorcycle shot Manalo three times at 7:15 a.m. while \nhe was returning home in Bauan, Batangas Province, about 60 miles \n(100 kilometers) south of the capital, Manila, according to news reports. \nManalo was pronounced dead at a local hospital.\nOn August 26, 2004, police arrested suspected gunman Michael Garcia, according \nto local news reports.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":275,"location":"India","year":"2006","name":"Arun Narayan Dekate","organization":"Tarun bharat","date":"June 10, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Nagpur","freelance":"No","description":"Up to four unidentified men attacked Dekate on June 8 as he was riding with a friend on a motorcycle, according to The Hindu newspaper.

He died before neighbors could get him to another hospital, local journalists told CPJ. Members of the Nigerian Union of Journalists told CPJ they believe Ohu was killed for his political reporting. They said the murder may be linked to his investigation into alleged fraud in the Customs Department.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records.

Agence France-Presse quoted an unnamed police official in 2009 as saying that Manneh had been spotted at Mile 2 Prison outside Banjul in 2008, but the official also speculated that Manneh was no longer alive.Over the years, despite dozens of inquiries from international organizations, the government did not provide a credible account of what happened to Manneh after he was taken into custody. In 2008, the Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ruled that Gambia had unlawfully seized Manneh, and ordered his immediate release.In a nationally televised meeting with local media representatives in March 2011, Jammeh described Manneh as having died, but denied any government involvement in the journalist's fate. \"Let me make it very clear that the government has nothing to do with the death of Chief Manneh,\" he said.The justice minister at the time, Edward Gomez, provided contradictory information several months later. In an October 2011 interview with the local newspaper Daily News, Gomez said that Manneh was alive. In a subsequent interview with AFP, Gomez said, \"Chief Ebrima Manneh is alive, and we will talk about this case later.”In February 2012, Reuters reported that Jammeh had asked the United Nations to investigate Manneh's disappearance. \"In response to civil society complaints about the disappearance of a journalist in the Gambia, the president of Gambia asked for the U.N. to come in and investigate,\" the U.N.'s then High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said, according to Reuters. But in a subsequent interview with CPJ, a government spokesman denied having any knowledge of the request to the U.N.On June 10, 2014, the ECOWAS court held that previous rulings against the Gambia, including in Manneh's case, proved the then Gambian government was fostering a climate of impunity, which in itself was a violation of freedom of expression.In a statement in November 2014, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said that two U.N. special rapporteurs had been unable to complete their investigation into the legal protection of prisoners in the Gambia after the Jammeh government denied them access to its prisons. The statement said the fact-finding mission was suspended.In January 2017, Adama Barrow was elected president of the Gambia, renewing hope that justice may be served for journalists missing and imprisoned under the Jammeh regime.Asked about Manneh’s case, Demba Ali Jawo, Gambian information minister for the Barrow administration, told CPJ, “Officially we have not heard anything yet. We have been getting rumors. We haven't got a lead.”The Gambia is organizing a truth and reconciliation commission for the crimes committed under the former government, which Jawo said may result in new information on journalists."},{"id":396,"location":"Nigeria","year":"1996","name":"Chinedu Offoaro","organization":"The guardian","date":"May 1, 1996","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Nigeria","freelance":"No","description":"Offoaro, a reporter for The Guardian, has been missing since the third week in May.

Jubelag said the two assailants were unmasked\nand fled the scene of the crime on a white Honda XRM motorcycle. The Associated\nPress quoted Fred Solinap, Guarin's co-anchor in their program on herbal\nmedicine, as saying that Guarin was puzzled by a text message he got during\ntheir radio broadcast on the day of his murder. The message, which Guarin read\non air, warned him in the local dialect not to leave the station or he would be\nkilled.\nThe Philippine National Police Criminal Investigation and\nDetection Group issued a statement on February 1 saying that it had filed\nmurder charges against suspected gunman Marvin Palabrica and launched a manhunt\nfor him, according to news reports.

His girlfriend, Honey Faith Indog, was wounded in the shoulder during the attack, and was treated for injuries at a local hospital, local news reports said. According to the reports, police recovered 7.62 and 5.56 millimeter cartridges from the crime scene. Lozada, known by his broadcast name Chris Rapido, hosted DBXF Prime's \"Kuskos Batikos\" public affairs program and served as vice president of Bislig City's media association, according to Rona Omo, a colleague at the station who was quoted by the news website Inquirer.  Prior to his death, Lozada had posted to his Facebook page several anonymous death threats he received via SMS on his mobile phone, the online news agency Rappler reported. On October 12 and 19, Lozada reported the threatening messages to local police, the reports said. The Presidential Task Force on Media Killings, established in October 2016 by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte to protect media workers and investigate unsolved journalist murders, said in a statement that it considered Lozada's death as a media killing. On November 7, Bislig City police arrested a suspect in the killing, according to the task force statement, which did not mention the detainee's name. The statement named Bislig City Mayor Librado Navarro as a person of interest in the case.  The task force also said in the statement that the local government barred investigators from taking hold of the van allegedly used in Lozada's murder.The national ombudsman office dismissed Navarro from his position in September this year for \"grave misconduct\" in the anomalous procurement of a hydraulic excavator on July 18, 2012, according to the news website Minda News.   Reports said that Lozada was involved in filing charges against Navarro and 11 other local officials who were dismissed in connection with the hydraulic excavator procurement, the Minda News report said. CPJ could not determine when the charges were filed.According to the local news website News Courier, Lozada also braodcast scatching commentary about the mayor on his \"Kuskos Batikos\" show. Navarro, who had previously sued Lozada for libel over his radio reporting in 2013, has denied any involvement in Lozada's murder, according to news reports.The Presidential Task Force on Media Killings said that Navarro had sent threatening text messages to Lozada telling him, \"to leave Bislig if you do not want to die\" and that \"he would step down [from office] with Lozada who will go to the cemetery since his days are numbered,\" according to a CNN report. Agence France-Presse reported that Lozada had filed reports about the threats he received from Navarro with the presidential task force in October.

At the time of the shooting, police reported that one of the victims, Suchart Charnchanavivat, had recently published articles in his local newspaper, Chao Mukdahan, accusing unidentified local journalists of bribe-taking and extortion. According to Thai journalists, there were other long-standing differences among the men, including allegations of theft lodged by the gunman against others in the group.The dinner at the floating restaurant was supposedly organized so that the men could settle their differences.Officials of the Thai Journalists Association say that the incident in Mukdahan might be related to the journalists' illegal business activities. It is not uncommon in Thailand for provincial newspaper stringers, who are notoriously underpaid, to use their positions to solicit bribes or to gain favors with local officials. Mukdahan is a center for a thriving border trade with neighboring Laos, which may also have played a role in the killing, according to Thai journalists. In the aftermath of the incident, the Press Council of Thailand issued a letter on December 10 calling on national newspapers to exercise more care in training and recruiting their provincial stringers in order to minimize corruption and unethical behavior.The Thai Journalists Association did not consider the attack to be related directly to journalism, but the bizarre nature of the tragedy makes it very difficult to sort out the gunman's motive."},{"id":409,"location":"Turkey","year":"2009","name":"Cihan Hayırsevener","organization":"Güney marmara’da yaşam","date":"December 19, 2009","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Bandirma","job":"Editor, Publisher / Owner","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Hayırsevener, 53, founder and editor of the daily Güney\nMarmara'da Yaşam, was shot three times in the leg while walking to his\noffice in the town of Bandirma, northeast of Istanbul, at about 3\np.m., according to news reports and CPJ interviews.

The faces of the assailants are not visible on the video, according to news reports.\n\n Pearl, 38, went missing on January 23 in the port city of Karachi, Pakistan, and was last seen on his way to an interview at the Village Restaurant, downtown near the Metropole Hotel. According to The Wall Street Journal, Pearl had been reporting on Richard Reid, a suspected terrorist who allegedly tried to blow up an airplane during a transatlantic flight with a bomb in his shoe.\n\n Four days after his disappearance, a group calling itself \"The National Movement for the Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty\" sent an e-mail to several U.S.- and Pakistan-based news organizations claiming responsibility for kidnapping Pearl and accusing him of being an American spy. The e-mail also contained four photographs of the journalist, including one in which he is held at gunpoint and another in which he is holding a copy of the January 24 issue of Pakistan's Dawn newspaper.\n\n The e-mail contained a series of demands, including the repatriation of Pakistani detainees held by the U.S. Army in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sender or senders, who used a Hotmail e-mail account under the name \"Kidnapperguy,\" said Pearl was \"at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances quite similar infact [sic] to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army.\"\n\n Another e-mail was sent on January 30, also including photographs of Pearl held captive. This e-mail accused him of being an agent of Mossad, Israel's spy agency, and said he would be killed within 24 hours unless the group's demands were met.\n\n After scrutinizing the videotape that officials received weeks later, authorities believe that Pearl may have been murdered before the second e-mail was sent. During that footage, Pearl is forced to identify himself as Jewish and to deliver scripted lines reiterating some of the demands made in the e-mails, according to an FBI analysis of the tape that was provided to the Journal.\n\n On February 12, before Pearl's murder was discovered, Pakistani police announced the arrest of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, whom they identified as the prime suspect behind the journalist's kidnapping.\n\n On March 14, a U.S. grand jury indicted Saeed, charging him with hostage-taking and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in Pearl's murder. U.S. prosecutors also unsealed a secret indictment filed against Saeed in November 2001 accusing him of participating in the 1994 kidnapping of U.S. tourist Bela Nuss in India. Pakistan refused to extradite Saeed, possibly to avoid damaging disclosures of links between the country's intelligence agencies and militant Islamist groups that the United States wants to see eliminated.\n\n In April, Saeed and three accomplices--Salman Saqib, Fahad Naseem, and Shaikh Adil--were charged with Pearl's kidnapping and murder before Pakistan's special anti-terrorism court. The trial, initially convened at Karachi's Central Jail and later moved to a heavily guarded prison in Hyderabad due to security concerns, was closed to journalists and the public.\n\n In mid-May, as the trial was under way, police found a dismembered body believed to be Pearl's buried in the outskirts of Karachi on property owned by the Al-Rashid Trust, an Islamic charity that the United States has accused of funneling money to al-Qaeda. Police were reportedly led to the shallow grave by Fazal Karim, a member of the banned militant Sunni Muslim group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. At year's end, Karim had not been charged, and though it has been widely reported that he was detained, authorities have never officially acknowledged his arrest.\n\n On July 15, the anti-terrorism court announced that Saeed and his accomplices were guilty of Pearl's kidnapping and murder. Saeed, who was accused of masterminding the crime, was sentenced to death by hanging; Saqib, Naseem, and Adil each received 25-year prison sentences. They have appealed the ruling, and the case was still pending at year's end.\n\n Shortly after the ruling, U.S. officials announced DNA test results confirming that the body found in May was indeed Pearl's.\n\n In mid-August, The Associated Press (AP) published a detailed account of Pearl's kidnapping, citing two investigators who spoke on condition of anonymity. The officials said that, according to Karim (who had led police to the journalist's body in May) and two others held in unofficial custody, Pearl was shot and wounded on the sixth day of his capture when he tried to escape and was murdered on the ninth day. The AP identified the two other detainees as Zubair Chishti and Naeem Bukhari, who is also known as Attaur Rehman and is a leader of the sectarian group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. The men also said that three Arabs, possibly from Yemen, were brought to the hideout on the ninth day, and that they were involved in filming and carrying out the execution.\n\n Karim later identified one of the Yemenis among those arrested in a September 11, 2002, raid in Karachi, during which U.S. and Pakistani authorities detained several suspected al-Qaeda members, including Ramzi Binalshibh, allegedly a senior al-Qaeda leader who has claimed a central role in coordinating the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Karim and Bukhari \"have told police that the man who slit Pearl's throat was Khalid Sheik Mohammed,\" whom U.S. intelligence officials have identified as the current head of al-Qaeda's military operations. U.S. officials have told journalists that Mohammed was not among those captured in the Karachi raids, and that his current status is unclear. He had appeared with Binalshibh in a pre-recorded interview broadcast by the Qatar-based Arabic-language satellite channel Al-Jazeera to coincide with the anniversary of the September 11 attacks.\n\n A former U.S. intelligence officer, Robert Baer, told the United Press International (UPI) news agency that he had given Pearl information about Mohammed, and that he believes it was the journalist's investigations of Mohammed that may have cost him his life. Baer, who worked for the Central Intelligence Agency for more than 20 years in Asia and the Middle East and wrote the book See No Evil, which criticizes the CIA, told UPI, \"I have heard from [intelligence] people who follow this closely that it was people close to Mohammed that killed him, if it wasn't Mohammed himself.\"\n\n UPI quoted a Wall Street Journal spokesperson as saying that, \"Everything we know from before and after Danny's murder indicates his reporting effort focused on [alleged shoe bomber] Richard Reid.\""},{"id":421,"location":"Philippines","year":"2009","name":"Daniel Tiamson","organization":"Untv","date":"November 23, 2009","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Ampatuan","freelance":"No","description":"In the deadliest event for the press ever recorded by CPJ, 30 \nPhilippine journalists and at least one media support worker were ambushed and \nbrutally slain on November 23 as they traveled in Maguindanao province with a \nconvoy of people who intended to file gubernatorial candidacy papers for a local \npolitician. In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism \napparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped \nin a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan.\nA \nfact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for \nFilipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, \nMindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said \nmost of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with \nsome employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an \nentire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities \nof General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting \nthat most of the victims were married and had children.\nThe entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in \nsupport of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial \ngovernor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel \nwith the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and \ninvited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent \nwitnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media \nreports.\nPolice quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu \nUnsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect \nbehind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his \ninnocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan \nabducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. \nReuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies \nhad both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied \nbehind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and \nother sources reported.\nThe journalists were not directly targeted for their work, \nbut were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans \ncompeting for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s \ndecades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine \narmy.\nIn their \nfact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of \nconcerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene \nhad not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about \nseveral days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of \nexcavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also \nexpressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of \nhomes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence. \n\nThe report, \nquoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might \nhave been dug several days before the massacre.\nThe massacre \noccurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed \nForces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to \nhave seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot \nthat would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said.\nNo \nsingle event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ \nbegan compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior \nevent for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of \nAl-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":422,"location":"Guatemala","year":"2015","name":"Danilo López","organization":"Prensa libre","date":"March 10, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Mazatenango","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Crime, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Two gunmen shot dead López, a reporter for the Guatemala City daily Prensa Libre, and Federico Salazar, a reporter for the Guatemala City station Radio Nuevo Mundo, while the journalists were walking in a park in Mazatenango, the capital of southwest Suchitepéquez department. A third journalist, Marvin Túnchez, a reporter for the local Canal 30 cable TV station, was also injured in the shooting. The gunmen fled on a motorcycle.\nLópez had worked as a correspondent in Suchitepéquez for Prensa Libre for more than a decade and often wrote about corruption and the misuse of public funds, according to the paper. He had also compared corrupt politicians to mafia dons on his Twitter account, Prensa Libre reported.\nAccording to the Guatemalan online investigative journalism outlet Plaza Pública which cited an official at the attorney general's unit for crimes against journalists who asked not to be identified, López called the official an hour before he was killed and told him he was frightened and that the environment in Mazatenango was \"very charged.\" López told the official that his fear was related to his investigation into a story on money laundering in Suchitepéquez, according to Plaza Pública.\nMiguel Angel Méndez Zetina, editor of Prensa Libre, said that the journalist \"received constant threats by municipal authorities for his stories about government corruption,\" according to the paper. In 2013, López was publicly threatened by a public official after the journalist published a story about public works projects in the town, according to the Guatemalan press freedom group CERIGUA.\nIn an interview conducted in early 2014 but published after his death, López said that members of organized crime had infiltrated the local government and law enforcement. \"No one trusts the police,\" he said. \"This makes the justice system very weak ... because there are groups occupying space in the public life.\"\nIn an interview after the attack, Túnchez told the Guatemalan daily Publinews that the gunmen \"approached Danilo directly.

Authorities requested that the investigation be transferred to a special court in the capital dedicated to high risk cases after local prosecutors investigating the crime received threats, according to the reports.\nIn June 2015, authorities arrested two police officers and a third man suspected of forming part of the criminal network that is suspected of being involved in the crime. In November 2015, prosecutors accused three members of the Public Ministry and two lawyers of leaking confidential information about criminal cases, including the investigation into the journalists' murder, to criminal groups.

The car that she was driving exploded near to her house in Bidnija, in the north of the island, media reported.Caruana Galizia, who reported on government corruption and the Panama Papers, told police two weeks prior her death that she had received death threats, according to Malta's national broadcaster TVM, which did not provide further detail. The journalist's blog, Running Commentary, which included investigative reports and commentary on politicians, was one of the most widely read websites in Malta, according to reports.A forensic expert was cited in local media as saying that preliminary investigations suggest that explosives were not placed inside the car, and that a remote control could have been used to set the bomb off. Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat announced that the FBI had agreed to assist local police in the investigation, according to Reuters. Muscat condemned the attack, which he described as an \"attack on press freedom.\" The Prime Minister added in a statement, \"Everyone knows Ms. Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally but nobody can justify this barbaric act in any way.\"Caruana Galizia's reports about Muscat's alleged connection to the Panama Papers scandal forced him to call early elections in June 2017, after harsh criticism from members of the European Parliament. The journalist alleged that Muscat and his wife were behind an offshore company that received over US$1 million in payments from a Dubai company allegedly owned by Leyla Aliyeva, daughter of Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev. Muscat denied the allegations, according to reports.Caruana Galizia's last blog, which was critical of the country's opposition party, was posted at 2:35 p.m. local time, just a few minutes before she left her house, according to local reports.The journalist's critical coverage led to several legal battles. The most recent came in August, when Malta’s opposition leader Adrian Delia filed four lawsuits against Caruana Galizia, and accused her of libel for reports she published on her blog. Caruana Galizia’s articles claimed that Delia laundered a total of £1 mln (U.S.$1.3 million) from prostitution in London through offshore accounts in his name, according to British and local media. Delia denied the allegations, and said the account belonged to his client. According to media reports, Delia also said he had resigned from the company that owned the property where the prostitution was allegedly taking place after becoming aware of the way in which it was being used.  CPJ documented in February how a court ordered Caruana Galizia’s bank accounts to be frozen until a verdict was reached in a libel case that two government officials had filed against her. A public fundraising campaign later raised enough cash to satisfy the court’s demands, according to EuroNews.On December 4, 2017, Maltese police, armed forces, and security services arrested 10 suspects in connection with the murder, Prime Minister Muscat announced. Seven were released on bail and three--Vince Muscat and two brothers named George and Alfredo Degiorgio--were charged with murder, criminal use of explosives, being involved in organized crime, and criminal conspiracy, according to reports. The three pleaded not guilty when they appeared before a judge in December 2017, Maltese media reported.In a statement, the Caruana Galizia family criticized the lack of communication from Maltese authorities regarding the arrests, saying that they were not contacted in advance and learned about the developments at the same time as the press. The manner in which the arrests were communicated, the family said, indicated “serious institutional deficiencies which are cause for general public concern.”Further, the family has taken legal action against the Maltese police, alleging that the investigation cannot be impartial because Caruana Galizia wrote critical articles about the chief investigator and the government minister to whom he is married, according to news reports. Members of the European Parliament who visited Malta in late November 2017 criticized the country's rule of law and noted a \"perception of impunity\" among government officials, according to reports."},{"id":426,"location":"Bosnia","year":"1994","name":"Dario D'Angelo","organization":"Rai-tv","date":"January 28, 1994","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Mostar","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Paramilitary Group","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Dario D'Angelo, Marco Luchetta, and Alessandra Otta, all Italian journalists working for RAI-TV, were killed by mortar fire from Bosnian Croats as they drove into Mostar.

These attacks resembled an August 2000 arson attack on the offices of the independent Banjul-based station Radio 1 FM.\nOn June 10, 2014, a panel of three justices in the Nigeria-based Economic Community of West African States Court of Justice ruled that Gambia's National Intelligence Agency, which was tasked with investigating Hydara's murder, did not carry out a proper investigation and cited the agency's failure to carry out ballistic tests on the bullets and weapons recovered from suspects.

The Abtaa Media Office employee said al-Jahad's anti-Nusra Front opinions were widely known in Abtaa and that the group \"was the most likely culprit of this terrible crime.\" An official from the Local Coordination Committees in Daraa, who asked not to be named, also told CPJ that al-Jahad's anti-Nusra Front views were known among local activists.\n\nCPJ was unable to determine if al-Jahad or Abu Halawa had been threatened by the Nusra Front.\n\n\nThe day before the attack, three moderate rebel brigades based in southern Syria formed a new coalition called the First Army. In its opening statement, the coalition distanced itself from the Nusra Front. Speaking to CPJ via Skype, the Local Coordination Committees official said that the two rebels killed alongside al-Jahad and Abu Halawa were members of the First Army. \"They may have been the intended targets of the gunmen, who were probably from Nusra, [rather than the journalists],\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Orient TV disputed the claim that the Nusra Front was behind the attack. Ahmad al-Deiri told CPJ a pro-government militia called the National Resistance Movement in Houran was trying to kill prominent activists and rebel figures in Daraa. The channel had heard rumors that this militia was responsible for the journalists' deaths, al-Deiri said. The Orient TV spokesperson was unable to provide evidence to support this account.\n\nThe day Abu Halawa and al-Jahad were killed, the paper Al-Quds al-Arabi ran a story about the militia's strategy in the south, but the report did not mention journalists being targeted for attack.\n\nNo group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack."},{"id":458,"location":"Brazil","year":"2015","name":"Djalma Santos da Conceição","organization":"Rca fm","date":"May 22 or 23, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Conceição da Feira","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Corruption, Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"Yes","threatened":"Yes","description":"Santos da Conceição's body was found with signs of torture in the northeast state of Bahia, one day after he was kidnapped by armed assailants, according to news reports.\nSantos da Conceição, who was also a musician and owned a bar, was playing samba in his bar in the neighboring town of Governador Mangabeira on the night of May 22 when armed and hooded men appeared at the establishment, according to news reports.

According to local press reports, the cameraman's widow, Svetlana Zavadskaya, initiated the judicial process in October 2003. Zavadsky's body was never recovered following his abduction.\n\nThe journalist was reported missing after he failed to keep a scheduled late-morning rendezvous on July 7, 2000, with his longtime colleague and friend Pavel Sheremet at the airport in Minsk.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal media reported that Zavadsky had been seen inside the airport not long before Sheremet's flight arrived from Moscow. Zavadsky's car was later found locked and parked outside the airport building. A search for the journalist by local police and officials from the local prosecutor's office turned up no clues.\n\nSheremet, a former ORT bureau chief in Minsk who now heads the station's special projects department in Moscow, had recently traveled to Chechnya with Zavadsky to shoot \"The Chechen Diary,\" a four-part documentary about the war there. CPJ sources in Belarus suspect that Zavadsky was abducted because he had footage that showed Belarusian security agents fighting alongside Chechen rebel forces.\n\nSheremet and Zavadsky's wife told reporters that shortly after Zavadsky returned from Chechnya, he began receiving phone calls from an unknown man who insisted on a meeting.\n\nZavadsky was President Aleksandr Lukashenko's personal cameraman until 1996. During the summer of 1997, local police detained Sheremet and Zavadsky while they were filming a documentary about smuggling between Belarus and Lithuania. They later received a suspended sentence for alleged illegal border crossing.\n\nSheremet has repeatedly accused Belarusian intelligence agents of being involved in Zavadsky's disappearance. Although investigators have publicly rejected this theory, Sheremet claims they do not rule it out in private. The Belarusian prosecutor's office has \"cautiously hinted that former agents of the Belarus secret services, along with some of their Russian counterparts, might have been involved,\" Sheremet told the local news agency BelaPAN.\n\nSenior Belarus officials, including Acting Interior Minister Mikhail Udovikov, have hinted that Zavadsky's disappearance may have resulted from his pro-Russian coverage of the war in Chechnya. They have also suggested that the journalist was kidnapped, either by his ORT colleagues, including Sheremet, or by members of the local opposition.\n\nIn addition to the threatening phone calls Zavadsky had received before his disappearance, two men were spotted trailing the journalist near his apartment building on the day he disappeared, Zavadsky's neighbors told police. The police commissioned artist sketches of the alleged stalkers but refused to release them. In early August 2000, police also collected samples of Zavadsky's hair from his family for testing without explaining the purpose of the tests.\n\nLater that month, police classified Zavadsky's disappearance as a premeditated crime and announced they had identified five suspects. The primary suspect, a leader of the Belarusian branch of the ultraright Russian National Unity movement named Valery Ignatovich, was in prison by the end of 2000. Police ruled out the theory that Belarusian security agents had been involved in the crime.\n\nOn November 20, 2000, local independent media had received an unsigned e-mail from a person who identified himself as an officer of the Belarus State Security Committee involved in the Zavadsky investigation. The writer claimed that nine suspects had been arrested, seven of whom were either current or former officers of the Presidential Security Service, and that the suspects had confessed to killing Zavadsky and had named the place where his body was buried. According to the e-mail, the investigators had also found a shovel stained with Zavadsky's blood.\n\nAdditionally, the e-mail claimed that President Lukashenko refused to allow investigators to exhume the body, and that the case was later transferred from the Prosecutor's Office to the Interior Ministry to sabotage the investigation.\n\nThe next day, the Belarusian State Security Council denounced the allegations, while Lukashenko blamed Zavadsky's disappearance on Chechen kidnappers. At the same time, Sheremet told BelaPAN he believed that the information from the anonymous e-mailer might be trustworthy, while local sources told CPJ that they had received similar information from other anonymous sources close to the investigation.\n\nA week after the e-mail was made public, Lukashenko fired four senior aides: his adviser on security issues, the chairman of the Security Council, the prosecutor general, and the head of the State Security Committee. Lukashenko claimed that the four men had been plotting a coup and had abducted Zavadsky in an effort to compromise the president.\n\nInterior Minister Vladimir Naumov promised to resolve the case no later than January 2001. Local observers questioned the integrity of the investigation, however, given that Naumov once headed the special police unit, Almaz, some of whose members were suspected of being involved in the crime.\n\nOn March 14, 2002, two former Almaz members, Valery Ignatovich and Maxim Malik, were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for abducting Zavadsky. Prosecutors argued that Ignatovich and Malik kidnapped the journalist in reprisal for an interview he had given to the Minsk-based Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta during which he alleged that certain unnamed Belarusians had fought with Chechen rebels against Russian forces.\n\nThe trial was held behind closed doors in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Journalists were only allowed into the courtroom for the reading of the sentence.\n\nZavadsky's lawyer and family said the trial failed to examine credible allegations that Belarusian authorities were also involved in the abduction. Sergei Tsurko, a lawyer for Zavadsky's family, claims that Ignatovich and Malik are scapegoats and that real responsibility lies with the Belarusian government.\n\nOn March 25, 2002, the missing cameraman's relatives filed a petition with the Belarusian Supreme Court, claiming that prosecutors had not sufficiently proven that Ignatovich and Malik were responsible for kidnapping Zavadsky. The petition urged further investigation into Zavadsky's abduction and his subsequent fate.\n\nIn June 2002, two former employees of the Prosecutor General's Office, Dmitry Petrushkevich and Oleg Sluchek, who had alleged that President Lukashenko had derailed the investigation because of evidence linking a government-led death squad to Zavadsky's murder, were granted asylum in the United States.\n\nZavadsky's colleague Pavel Sheremet and local opposition groups have supported these claims.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has also publicly validated Petrushkevich and Sluchek's claims. \"We think these revelations are important,\" State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a June 19, 2002, press briefing.\n\nTwo weeks later, on July 3, 2002, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs Paula Dobriansky and other U.S. officials met with Petrushkevich and Sluchek to discuss Zavadsky's disappearance and several other cases in which Belarusian individuals were allegedly murdered for political reasons, Agence France-Presse reported.\n\nOn November 28, 2003, a district court in Minsk declared Zavadsky officially dead. Judge Nataliya Andreyeva spent several hours examining evidence presented by the Public Prosecutor's Office that the ORT cameraman had died after his abduction and then officially changed Zavadsky's status from missing to dead.\n\n\"This was done for property-related reasons so that my apartment can be registered in my name,\" Zavadskaya told CPJ. \"I still want to find out the truth about my husband and what happened to him.\"\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office ended its investigation into the Zavadsky case in January 2003, claiming they had pursued all available leads in the cameraman's disappearance.\n\nOn December 10, 2003, prosecutors announced they had reopened the investigation about 48 hours before the Council of Europe, a pan-Europe human rights monitoring organization, released a report alleging that high-level government officials were involved in the journalist's disappearance and its subsequent cover-up.\n\nHowever, Ivan Branchel, deputy head of the prosecutor's Organized Crime and Corruption Department, sent a letter to Zavadskaya in early April 2004 informing her that the case was closed on March 31, 2004, said the Minsk-based human rights group Charter 97.\n\nAuthorities have refused to give Zavadskaya information about the investigation, which relatives of victims are authorized to obtain under Belarus law, said Zavadskaya."},{"id":469,"location":"Mexico","year":"2005","name":"Dolores Guadalupe García Escamilla","organization":"Stereo 91","date":"April 16, 2005","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Nuevo Laredo","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Crime","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Crime reporter García Escamilla died from injuries she suffered in an April 5 shooting in front of her radio station in the border city of Nuevo Laredo.

Several people witnessed the murder.\n\n In an October 1, 2002, editorial, Folha do Estado blamed the murder on a \"parallel power,\" a reference to organized crime groups that it said had taken over Mato Grosso.

Two days later, police announced that ballistic tests confirmed one of the weapons found was used in Brandão's murder.\n\n In early December 2002, a federal judge ordered that former police officer-turned-businessman João Arcanjo Ribeiro be held in temporary detention after federal and state prosecutors identified him as the head of a major organized crime group and linked him to several homicides, including the murder of Brandão. Ribeiro fled, and was arrested in Uruguay in 2003 and held in detention there while awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\n Later that month, Ribeiro was formally charged with masterminding Brandão's murder in retaliation for his newspaper's criticism of organized crime and illegal gambling. Ribeiro also faced homicide, smuggling, money laundering, tax evasion, illegal gambling, and racketeering charges. Prosecutors also charged former police officers Araújo and Alves with involvement in the murder. Two suspects arrested the same month, João Leite and Fernando Barbosa Belo, were charged as accomplices.\n\n In December 2003, Araújo was convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison.

He was killed by a single bullet wound to his left torso.\n\n On May 16, local police superintendent Asuri Hawani announced that police had identified and filed charges against an alleged hit man named Ronie Quilme based on an eyewitness' account. But the two witnesses riding in Damalerio's jeep, Edgar Amoro and Edgar Ongue, identified the gunman as local police officer Guillermo Wapile. Although an investigator from the National Bureau of Investigation said his office had recommended as early as May 17 that local prosecutors arrest Wapile, the suspect was not formally arrested. Instead, he was placed in the custody of his boss, Hawani, under \"restricted supervision\" with his fellow police officers. He was not formally charged, and could move freely in Pagadian City. According to news reports, he was seen in town stalking the witnesses and their family members during 2002.\n\n CPJ believes that Damalerio, known for his critiques of corruption among local politicians and the police, was killed for his journalistic work. According to local news reports, the journalist had criticized Hawani on his radio show for his alleged involvement with drug traffickers and crime syndicates.\n\n The day of Damalerio's murder, his wife alerted him that she had noticed two men \"casing the house,\" according to a report in the Philippine Daily Inquirer by Hernan de la Cruz, publisher of the Zamboanga Scribe. Damalerio called his wife 30 minutes before he was killed to let her know that he was on his way home. The journalist advised her to \"just close the door and lock the gate. Be careful.\"\n\n A few hours before Damalerio was shot, an employee of the Zamboanga Scribe reported receiving a number of mysterious anonymous telephone calls. On May 14, the day after the journalist's death, an unidentified male made threatening phone calls to the newspaper warning that publisher de la Cruz may be next. (De la Cruz now has a uniformed army soldier as his bodyguard.)\n\n On August 10, a possible third witness in the case, a member of a local civilian militia named Juvy Lovitaño, was murdered. He had recently contacted the National Bureau of Investigation to report that a local police officer had approached him to take out a contract on Damalerio's life.\n\n In August 2002, CPJ conducted an in-depth investigation into Damalerio's murder and met with government officials, including Interior Secretary Joey Lina, to try to move prosecution efforts forward. Lina, who dismissed Pagadian police chief Asuri Hawani after Damalerio's assassination for \"covering up the crimes of his men,\" has ordered a special investigation into the murder.\n\n Amoro and Ongue, the two witnesses riding in the car with Damalerio when he was shot, were under threat and went into the witness protection program. Fearing death threats against her and her baby boy, Damalerio's widow, Gemma, went into hiding in another province under the protection program. Despite the risks for their own safety, Damalerio's family and colleagues continued to pressure regional authorities for justice.\n\n On January 30, 2003, the Pagadian City regional trial court ordered Wapile's arrest. Wapile had been temporarily reassigned at the time to Camp Abelon in Pagadian City, where he was supposed to be restricted to the premises under the supervision of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Provincial Director Pedrito Reye.\n\n Apparently tipped off, Wapile managed to escape and evaded arrest for more than a year. In mid-2004, with a missing suspect and no leads, the case became \"dormant\" and Damlerio's widow, Amoro and Ongue lost their protection despite ongoing threats.\n\n International and domestic pressure to solve the Damalerio murder case increased until Wapile surrendered to authorities on murder charges on September 13, 2004. He pleaded not guilty to the murder charges on September 24, 2004.\n\n But Wapile's arrest did not end the reign of terror for the eyewitnesses and family members. On February 5, 2005, gunmen shot and killed Amoro while he was leaving Zamboanga del Sur National High School where he worked as a teacher. Two of the three eyewitnesses to Damalierio's murder have been murdered to keep them from testifying in court.\n\n In a February 14 ruling, the Supreme Court granted the request of Damalerio's widow to transfer the trial from Pagadian City to the more neutral Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila. The Supreme Court also ordered the Cebu City court to ensure a speedy trial.\n\n Prison authorities were ordered to transfer Wapile from Pagadian City to Cebu City and ensure security to prevent another escape. There is still no official start date for the trial. According to local journalists, the prosecution is modifying its case, possibly to include charges against former Pagadian City Police Chief Azuri Hawani.\n\n Gemma Damalerio, Amoro's widow, and Edgar Ongue are back in the witness protection program."},{"id":482,"location":"Mexico","year":"2017","name":"Edgar Daniel Esqueda Castro","organization":"Freelance","date":"October 5- 6, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"San Luis Potosí","job":"Photographer","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Crime, Culture","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group, Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"Yes","threatened":"Yes","description":"State authorities on the morning of October 6, 2017, found photographer Edgar Daniel Esqueda Castro dead near the airport in the city of San Luis Potosí, a spokesperson from the state attorney general’s office, Iván Ojeda, told CPJ. His body had three gunshot wounds, the office said. Federico Garza, the state attorney general, told CPJ on October 19, 2017, that the gunshots were the cause of Esqueda Castro’s death, and that the journalist’s body showed signs of torture. On October 20, 2017, Esqueda Castro's mother, Verónica Castro, and his widow, Xitlali Ramírez, told CPJ that armed men broke into the home the three shared in San Luis Potosí in the early morning of October 5, 2017.

Esqueda Castro reported both incidents to state authorities, and filed a complaint with the State Human Rights Commission, which confirmed both incidents to CPJ on October 20, 2017. The human rights commission said it issued a recommendation to state authorities that investigative police should stop harassing the journalist, and state authorities accepted the recommendation.In a statement released on October 6, 2017, the Federal Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists, a government body that provides protective measures to reporters under threat of violence, confirmed the threats against Esqueda Castro, and stated that it had offered him protective measures. According to the group, Esqueda Castro refused protection, and said that the journalist had not reported any further threats to the mechanism after the July incidents.In the October 20 interview, the journalist's family confirmed to CPJ that Esqueda Castro had not enrolled in a protection scheme."},{"id":483,"location":"Brazil","year":"1997","name":"Edgar Lopes de Faria","organization":"Fm capital","date":"October 29, 1997","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Campo Grande","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Television","coverage":"Crime, Human Rights","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Lopes de Faria, host of the programs \"O Escaramuça\" (The Fighter) on the local radio station FM Capital and \"Boca do Povo\" (The Mouth of the People) on television station TV Record, was murdered in Campo Grande, capital Mato Grosso do Sul State, while on his way to the radio station.

The journalist had been traveling by motorcycle from the town of Fram to Carmen del Paraná, his home city, according to the paper. The journalist did not regain consciousness after the attack, and spent a year in the hospital unable to move or speak, ABC Color reported.  González was a radio reporter with the local station F.M. Costanera del Sur, and had previously reported on police complacency in cattle rustling, according to media reports.Local authorities' initial reports suggested that González's injuries were the result of a traffic accident.\"The investigation did not find signs that the vehicle had braked or that it was hit by another vehicle,\" Chief of Police Juan Barua said in an interview with online channel Itapúa en Noticias, which was published on YouTube in March 2016. \"We presume that this person [González] came at a high velocity and the motorcycle fell. It skidded over the asphalt for various meters,\" he added.González's family and colleagues called for further investigation, according to press reports. The journalist's father, Carlos González, told Paraguayan press after his son's death in March 2017 that he believes his son was murdered.ABC Color reported in July 2016 that no damage was found to the motorcycle and raised doubts about whether the injuries were the result of a traffic accident.Police had previously arrested González on charges the journalist said were retaliation for his reporting. In September 2014, Fram police arrested González and charged him with drug possession and trafficking after allegedly finding six balls of crack cocaine in his bag, according to a report in ABC Noticias from the time of the arrest. González said that police had planted the drugs on him in reprisal for his reporting with the radio station Trigal F.M., according to the report. Three days prior to his arrest, González had reported on cattle rustling, according to an interview the journalist gave to the news website Itapúa en Noticias, which was published on YouTube in June 2015. After González spent a year in house arrest, a local judge dismissed the charges, according to a separate ABC Color report. José Miguel González, the ABC Color correspondent in Itapúa and president of the Association of Periodistas in the South (APESUR) told CPJ that, a week before Eduardo González was found unconscious, the radio reporter said that he had agreed to informally settle with police for 50 million guaranis (US$9,000) in lieu of filing suit against them for wrongful arrest.The ABC Color correspondent said that he believed that Eduardo González was killed so that police could be rid of the case without paying. José Miguel González added that González had continued reporting on the collusion between police and cattle thieves on his radio program after he was released from house arrest. The national police station in Fram did not immediately respond to CPJ's request for comment in December 2017. After González's death, Edward Irala, the assistant prosecutor in Itapúa, told journalists during a press conference that the investigation into the circumstances under which González appeared unconscious on the roadside was still open after his death in March 2017. Irala said that prosecutors were also investigating the possibility that González was planning to file a wrongful arrest suit against the Fram police officers who had charged him with drug crimes, according to a video of the press conference from Itapúa en Noticias on YouTube."},{"id":493,"location":"Guatemala","year":"2006","name":"Eduardo Maas Bol","organization":"Radio punto","date":"September 9, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Cobán","freelance":"No","description":"Maas, 58, Cobán correspondent for the Guatemala City-based Radio Punto, was found dead at around 4 a.m. in his parked car near the road that connects central Cobán to Guatemala City.Maas was shot four times, in the head, left arm, back, and chest, local prosecutor Genaro Pacheco told CPJ.

Moreno's announcement followed several contradictory statements by the Colombian and Ecuadoran governments about the state of the hostages and whether they were being held in Colombia or Ecuador, according to the Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom.Segarra had worked as a driver for 36 years, 16 of them with El Comercio, according to the newspaper. During that time, he transported reporters to cover national stories including a devastating earthquake in April 2016 and the eruption of the Cotopaxi volcano in August 2015.

In the video, Ortega says that the group's captors wanted to carry out a prisoner exchange and urged Moreno to comply with their demands. \"Mr. President, our lives are in your hands,\" Ortega said.On April 11, RCN received a communiqué which stated that it was from Arizala's group, saying that the all three had been killed amid a military operation.

At the entrance, the attackers killed one person--whom Molins did not name--and proceeded to the second floor, where a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting was taking place, reports said.\nThe Guardian reported that among the victims were Cayat; Moustapha Ourrad, a copy editor for the paper; Philippe Honoré, a columnist for the paper; Stephane Charbonnier, editor of Charlie Hebdo; Bernard Maris, a shareholder and columnist who wrote under the penname \"Uncle Bernard\"; and cartoonists Jean Cabut, known as Cabu; Georges Wolinski; and Bernard Verlhac, known as Tignous.\nFollowing the attack, the killers fled to the street, where they shot and killed a police officer before getting away in a black car, reports said.\nNo organization immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. News reports cited witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and referred to the Prophet Muhammad. \nCayat was a practicing psychoanalyst and psychotherapist, but also wrote a bi-weekly column for Charlie Hebdo, called \"Charlie Divan\" (Charlie's couch). She was also the author of a number of books and essays.\nCharlie Hebdo has been under threat from Islamic extremists and under police protection since the magazine was fire-bombed in 2011, a day after it published a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad and a spoof edition \"guest edited\" by the Prophet, according to news reports.\nThe attack occurred in a highly tense and politically volatile climate in a country confronted with the departure of hundreds of French citizens to fight with Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq; controversies around the place of Islam in French society; and the rise of the nationalist political party National Front, which topped the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament.\nCharlie Hebdo's most recent cover featured a cartoon on writer Michel Houellebecq, whose new book published the same day as the attack, Soumission (Submission), imagined the victory of a Muslim president by 2022 in France, according to news reports.\nIn the days following the attack, police identified two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, as the gunmen, according to news reports. On January 9, 2015, following a standoff with police during which the brothers held one hostage, the two were shot dead in a printing warehouse northeast of Paris, news reports said. The hostage was freed. On the same day, police also shot dead Amedy Coulibaly, who had taken hostages at a supermarket in Paris on January 9 and was accused of having killed a police officer the day before, news reports said.\nCoulibaly and Chérif Kouachi were both followers of Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian who served a 10-year prison term in France in 2001 for participating in a plot to bomb the U.S. embassy, according to news reports. \nOn January 14, 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility for the attack, according to news reports.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":519,"location":"Philippines","year":"2009","name":"Ernie Rollin","organization":"Dxsy radio","date":"February 23, 2009","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Oroquieta City","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Two men shot Rollin at around 5:30 a.m. at a gas station in Oroquieta City in the Philippine province of Misamis Occidental, according to a statement issued by the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines and local news reports.\nThe men, who were riding a motorcycle and wearing ski masks, shot him at least three times while he was parking at a gas station, the reports said.

Aceh military spokesman Lt. Col. Firdaus Komarno told Agence France-Presse that the firefight broke out when Indonesian soldiers came across a group of rebels in the area. Siregar's body and the body of a rebel fighter were found later.\n\nAccording to news reports, the rebels accused the military of executing Siregar. In response, the military has claimed that the rebels were using the journalist as a human shield.\n\nSiregar, 52, was kidnapped on June 29 by rebels from the Free Aceh Movement, known by its Indonesian acronym GAM, along with cameraman Fery Santoro, their driver, and two Indonesian officers' wives who were sharing a ride with the journalists to the town of Lhokseumawe in northern Aceh. The RCTI crew had been reporting on the military offensive in Aceh, which was launched on May 19 to crush the long-running rebel insurgency. On July 3, a spokesman for the rebels announced that the group was being held on suspicion of working for the Indonesian military (TNI).\n\nGAM later dropped that accusation, but various attempts to secure the release of the hostages failed. On July 6, TNI Cmdr. Gen. Endriartono Sutarto set a deadline of July 8 for GAM to release the hostages or else face military attack. That same day, Imam Wahyudi, an editor at RCTI, and nine other journalists were allowed to meet with Siregar and reported that Siregar and Santoro were in good health. After GAM failed to meet the July 8 deadline, military officials questioned Wahyudi and the other journalists who had met with Siregar about how they were able to contact GAM and locate their base.\n\nFurther negotiations between the military and the rebels stalled over the rebels' demands for a seven-day ceasefire and that the military not be involved in the transfer of the hostages. TNI rejected the demands and proposed instead the creation of a battle-free zone where the hostages could be transferred from GAM control. Meanwhile, on October 4, the Jakarta Post reported that Siregar was suffering from deteriorating health, including coughing up blood.\n\nOn November 5, Indonesian security minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ordered the military to start an operation to locate the hostages, accusing GAM of being \"a terror group which takes reporters and innocent civilians hostage.\"\n\nOn December 19, the driver was released unharmed.The two wives were released in February 2004.

His head had been cut off and was found 100 meters from the rest of his body, which was badly decomposed, according to press reports. He was half naked and his hands were tied behind his back, the daily O Globo said. He still had his wallet, watch, and ring.\nThe journalist had last been seen in a local hotel on May 13, according to news reports. Francisco Couy, an officer with the local coroner's office, told CPJ by phone that Metzker was probably killed on May 13 or 14. The officer also read out details of the case in a YouTube video.\nMetzker, 67, wrote a blog called Coruja Do Vale, which focused on general political news and official wrongdoing in the impoverished north and eastern parts of Minas Gerais, one of Brazil's biggest states. The blog reported news such as arrests made at police roadblocks, parking violations by local authorities, and community interest stories, according to CPJ's review of its content.\nThe journalist's wife, Ilma Chaves Silva Borges, told CPJ that they lived in the town of Medina, but that Metzker had traveled to Padre Paraíso about three months ago to do some investigative work, about which she did not provide further details. \"He was doing investigative journalism in a region that is very dangerous,\" Borges told CPJ. \"There are lots of murders here. I think that the motive--given the barbarity of his murder--was because he hit on something. He investigated mayors, politicians, cargo robberies, prostitution,\" she said.\nThe magazine Época said that on his blog Metzker had published stories about government cars being used for personal use and poor local medical care, but that he was investigating even riskier stories about the activities of local criminal groups and drug traffickers. Several local news reports said Metzker had been investigating a child prostitution ring that was active in the area.

A local journalist who spoke with CPJ but asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal said he had never heard anything linking Metzker personally to such activity before his death.\nMetkzer's wife told local reporters she was certain her husband had been killed for his work.

He was one of two foreign journalists killed during\nviolent political unrest that gripped the capital for several weeks. Hiro\nMuramoto, a Japanese cameraman for Reuters, was killed in crossfire in April.\nBradley Cox, a Bangkok-based documentary filmmaker, said\nthat earlier on the morning of May 19, troops fired sporadically from behind a\nbarricade into areas 200 meters away that were controlled by red-shirted protesters\nfor the United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, or UDD. Cox,\ninterviewed for a CPJ special report, said both he and Polenghi had taken\nfootage of a protester shot in the leg around 10:45 a.m.\nAbout 15 minutes later, Cox said, sensing a lull in the\nshooting, he moved away from a barricade controlled by the UDD and into a nearly\nempty road to investigate a commotion among protesters approximately 30 to 40\nmeters away. Cox said Polenghi followed a few steps behind. While running down\nthe road, Cox felt a sudden, sharp pain in the side of his leg. It turned out\nthat a bullet had grazed his knee, causing minor injury. When he turned to look\nback in the direction of the troops, he saw Polenghi sprawled on the ground\nabout two or three meters behind him. Polenghi was wearing a blue helmet with\nthe word \"Press\" written across the front and back, and a green armband\nindicating that he was a working journalist.\n\"My feeling at the time was that we were shot at the exact\nsame time, perhaps even with the same bullet,\" said Cox, adding that he didn't\nhear the gunshot or shots that hit him or Polenghi. \"I don't know who shot me\nor Fabio, but if the military was trying to shoot red shirts, there was no one\naround us. ... Soldiers were firing at anything or anybody.\"\nVideo footage Cox subsequently took of journalists and\nprotesters who carried Polenghi's body out of the road and onto a motorcycle\nbound for a nearby local hospital appeared to show a bullet had entered\nPolenghi's body under his left armpit and exited through his side. He was\ndeclared dead on arrival at a local hospital, according to news reports.\nAuthorities did not report any bullet being recovered.\nPolenghi's family expressed concerns about the government's\nopaque investigation into the death. His sister, Elisabetta Polenghi, noted\nthat many of his belongings, including his camera and telephone, were missing.\nShe and a group of Polenghi's colleagues pieced together video clips--some\nreceived from journalists who were in Polenghi's vicinity, others downloaded\nfrom unknown sources on the Internet--to develop a timeline of movements before\nand after the shooting. There was no known footage of the shooting itself. One\nvideo clip showed that an unidentified man wearing a silver helmet was the\nfirst to reach Polenghi after he was shot.

The militant group accused him of \"collaborating with Baghdad,\" reports said.\nAl-Hadidi, who in some reports was named Ahmad Hasko al-Hadidi, was the editor of the privately owned newspaper Mosul al-Youm and wrote for Sada al-Iraq, a privately owned weekly socio-political newspaper, colleagues said. Mosul al-Youm has not been published since Islamic State took over Mosul.\nIn July 2014, a month after Islamic State took over Mosul, al-Hadidi, 59, was kidnapped from his home, local news reports said. Colleagues and media monitors with whom CPJ spoke during an investigative trip to the Iraqi city of Irbil in October 2015 said al-Hadidi was later killed, although the date of his death remains unclear.\nReports of his death began to emerge two weeks after he was taken. Ahmad al-Rubaei, from the Iraqi monitoring group Journalistic Freedoms Observatory, told CPJ al-Hadidi was killed on July 15, 2014. However, the Nineveh Media Foundation, a small Iraqi monitoring group, said that al-Hadidi's family were not summoned to identify his body until March 2015. As of October 2015, the Nineveh Media Foundation counted al-Hadidi among the seven journalists it says were killed by Islamic State since its takeover of Mosul. The monitoring group's criteria is based on whether Islamic State returned the victim's body to the family.\nAl-Hadidi's name appeared on a list of 2,070 Mosul residents Islamic State claims to have killed, which was posted in police stations and at coroner's offices in Mosul in September 2015. CPJ has not been able to independently verify that al-Hadidi's name appeared on the list.\nA close friend of al-Hadidi, who asked not to be identified out of security concerns, told CPJ in an interview in the Iraqi city of Irbil, that the print journalist had criticized Islamic State ideology in his writing, and was producing a pamphlet on the militant group's crimes. He also ran as a candidate in two elections, including for former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's State of Law coalition, the friend said. CPJ was unable to determine what years he ran for election.\nAlthough his political associations may have made him a target, al-Hadidi's journalism was a \"challenge to Islamic State's message,\" a senior editor at a Mosul newspaper who knew al-Hadidi and who asked not to be named for security reasons, told CPJ."},{"id":531,"location":"Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory","year":"2008","name":"Fadel Shana","organization":"Reuters","date":"April 16, 2008","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Gaza Strip","job":"Camera Operator","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Cameraman Shana, 23, was killed and soundman Wafa Abu Mizyed\nwas wounded after they stopped their vehicle to film Israeli military forces\nseveral hundred feet away, Reuters reported.

Hamadi was the head of the production department for Eye on the Homeland, a Syrian news website, according to a statement on the group's Facebook page.Abd al-Qader worked as the executive director of Eye on the Homeland, the statement said. A member of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently told CPJ that Abd Al-Qader had been an early member of their group. The murders took place a few weeks before CPJ was to recognize Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently with its annual International Press Freedom Award.Supporters of the militant group Islamic State published a video on social media claiming responsibility two days after the murders. Text in the video said Islamic State murdered Abd al-Qader and Hamadi to warn all \"apostates [that] they will be slaughtered silently,\" mocking the name of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The video ends with footage of Hamadi's body, which had a deep gash that had nearly severed the neck. Abd al-Qader's body was not shown in the video.In an interview with NBC, published on November 2, 2015, Abd al-Qader's brother, Ahmed, who is one of the founders of Eye on the Homeland, accused a Syrian named Tlas Surur of murdering his brother and colleague. Ahmed Abd al-Qader said Surur arrived from Raqqa more than a month before the murder, claiming to have defected from Islamic State. But the story was a ruse to gain the journalists' trust, he said. On the night of the murder, Surur invited Ibrahim Abd al-Qader and Hamadi to his apartment across the street from where they lived. Surur was waiting with two accomplices, who have not been publicly identified, and the apartment's windows had been covered to hide the attack from onlookers, Ahmed Abd al-Qader said. He added that he believes Surur fled to Syria after the murder.According to Turkish media reports published the week after the murders, police found three footprints in blood and camera footage of one of the suspects. One police source, who was not named, told NBC that evidence implicated Surur in the murders.Since the start of the conflict, numerous Syrian journalists have operated independent media outlets in Turkey, including Eye on the Homeland. The Turkish authorities have largely allowed these outlets to report on Syria without harassment but Syrian journalists have repeatedly told CPJ they face restrictions on reporting on events inside Turkey and fear the Turkish government is not doing enough to protect them from potential threats emanating from Syria. Members of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently and Eye on the Homeland told CPJ they receive death threats on a daily basis for their reporting on Islamic State.Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, one of the few reliable and independent sources of news left in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, was established in April 2014. The group has been declared an \"enemy of God\" by Islamic State in retribution for its reporting. Eye on the Homeland, which was founded by a group of Syrian journalists and activists, reports on events in Syria through its website and a semi-monthly newspaper, according to the group's website.Police in the southeastern Turkish city of Urfa arrested a man news reportsidentified only as Muaz Al-A, whom police suspect murdered  Hamadi and Abd al-Qader.

He also worked in the Abtaa Media Office, a local press center circulating news on Facebook from news outlets and opposition groups.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":563,"location":"Philippines","year":"2013","name":"Fernando Solijon","organization":"Dxls love radio","date":"August 29, 2013","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Iligan City","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Two gunmen on a motorcycle shot Solijon while he was walking to\nhis car after having dinner with a friend at around 10:30 p.m. in Bur-un\nvillage of Iligan City, in Lanao del Norte province of Northern Mindanao\nregion, according to news reports.

Syafruddin, also known as Udin, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a Catholic hospital in Yogyakarta but never regained consciousness. He died in the hospital three days after the attack. Local sources speculated that Syafruddin's death may have been related to his articles on land disputes and government corruption in Bantul, the Yogyakarta suburb that he covered for Bernas.  CPJ sent a letter to President Suharto on August 20 expressing alarm about the murder. The committee called on the Indonesian leader to order a complete investigation into Syafruddin's death, as well as public disclosure of the investigation's findings.  In October, Indonesia's National Committee on Human Rights began an inquiry into Syafruddin's death, and police in Jogyakarta arrested a suspect. However, according to press reports, Syafruddin's widow claimed that the suspect, Dwi Sumadji, was not one of the men she saw kill her husband. She says he is a foil to deflect blame from the guilty parties.  In December, the Indonesian Journalist Association (PWI) told reporters that Syafruddin was beaten to death because of his stories about corruption, and not by a jealous husband as policed alleged shortly after the attack. PWI chairman Sofyan Lubis said that evidence and testimony at the trial of the alleged killer confirmed the association's findings. The court concluded that there was insufficient evidence against Sumadji, and prosecutors dropped the charges against him. The ruling led to an investigation into the conduct of two police officers accused of forcing Sumadji to admit he killed Syafruddin because the reporter was having an affair with his wife."},{"id":589,"location":"India","year":"2007","name":"G.

The newspaper covered issues including communal violence and the caste system. Lankesh was part of a government panel involved in shaping a Maoist surrender to state police, according to reports. According to the BBC, the journalist was sympathetic to the Maoist rebels and was involved in the reintegration of former rebels.K. Siddaramiah, the chief minister of Karnataka state, has ordered a 21-member special investigation team from the police to investigate Lankesh’s killing, according to the Indian Express. Inderjit Lankesh, the journalist’s brother, said in an interview with NDTV that India’s national agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation, should examine her case. He said that Gauri Lankesh received a lot of hate mail from those who sympathised with the Maoist rebels and said that the investigation should investigate whether Hindu extremists or Maoist rebels are behind the killing, according to India Today. B.T. Venkatesh, a lawyer who represented Gauri Lankesh, alleged in an interview with the media watchdog The Hoot that her murder “was a pre-planned and sinister attack by Hindu terror units.” The radical right-wing Hindu group Sanatan Sanstha condemned Lankesh’s killing, according to reports. The group said that the journalist was a Maoist sympathiser who it had nothing to do with, according to reports.

At the time of her death, she was appealing a six-month prison sentence and fine of 10,000 Indian rupee (US$155) for criminal defamation.

At the entrance, the attackers killed one person--whom Molins did not name--and proceeded to the second floor, where a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting was taking place, reports said.\nThe Guardian reported that among the victims were Wolinski; Stephane Charbonnier, editor of Charlie Hebdo; Bernard Maris, a shareholder and columnist who wrote under the penname \"Uncle Bernard\"; cartoonists Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, and Bernard Verlhac, known as Tignous; Moustapha Ourrad, a copy editor and proofreader for the weekly; and Elsa Cayat and Philippe Honoré, columnists for the paper.\nFollowing the attack, the killers fled to the street, where they shot and killed a police officer before getting away in a black car, reports said.\nNo organization immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. News reports cited witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and referred to the Prophet Muhammad. \nWolinski's career as a cartoonist began in the 1960s for the French satirical magazine Hara-Kiri. When that publication was forced to close after mocking the death of French President Charles de Gaulle, he helped found Charlie Hebdo. He served as its editor from 1970 to 1981, according to the French daily Le Parisien.\nHis work appeared in several French publications including Paris-Match, where he worked as the political cartoonist for 30 years, according to news reports. He also worked for France Soir, Libération, and L'Humanité, reports said. In 2005, he was awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction.\nCharlie Hebdo has been under threat from Islamic extremists and under police protection since the magazine was fire-bombed in 2011, a day after it published a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad and a spoof edition \"guest edited\" by the Prophet, according to news reports.\nThe attack occurred in a highly tense and politically volatile climate in a country confronted with the departure of hundreds of French citizens to fight with Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq; controversies around the place of Islam in French society; and the rise of the nationalist political party National Front, which topped the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament.\nCharlie Hebdo's most recent cover featured a cartoon on writer Michel Houellebecq, whose new book published the same day as the attack, Soumission (Submission), imagined the victory of a Muslim president by 2022 in France, according to news reports.\nIn the days following the attack, police identified two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, as the gunmen, according to news reports.

In late November, a massive political scandal\nerupted after an opposition leader released an audiotape that seemed to\nimplicate Kuchma and two senior aides in Gongadze's disappearance.\n\nGongadze, 31, left the home of a colleague at 10:20 p.m. to meet his\nwife and two young children at home. He never arrived. The police\nlaunched an investigation, while the Ukrainian Parliament formed a\nspecial commission to examine the case.\n\nShortly after Gongadze disappeared, Deputy Interior Minister Mykola\nDzhyha announced that authorities were considering three possible\nscenarios: that Gongadze had staged his own abduction, that he had been\ninvolved in an accident, or that the abduction was related to his\njournalism.\n\nOn September 19, however, Dzhyha announced that the police had ruled\nout any political motive. The police then suggested that the\ndisappearance was related to Gongadze's personal life. CPJ expressed\nserious doubts about the credibility of the investigation in a\nSeptember 25 letter to President Kuchma.\n\n          On the night of November 2-3, a farmer discovered a headless corpse outside the town of\n          Tarashcha, and local journalists immediately speculated that it might be Gongadze's. On\n          November 6, regional officials visited Tarashcha to conduct an investigation.\n\nThe officials quickly announced that the advanced decomposition of the\nbody placed the time of death well before the date of Gongadze's\ndisappearance. They did not ask anyone from the journalist's family to\nidentify the body, however. Despite the local coroner's pleas to have\nthe body removed, it remained in an unrefrigerated morgue in Tarashcha,\nwhere it continued to decompose.\n\nPersistent rumors of a cover-up led several of Gongadze's colleagues to\nvisit Tarashcha on November 15. Based on jewelry found at the scene and\nan X-ray of the corpse's hand, which showed an old shrapnel injury\nmatching one that Gongadze had suffered while covering the conflict in\nAbkhazia, a region of Georgia, they concluded that the corpse was\nindeed Gongadze's.\n\nThe local coroner issued a death certificate to the group confirming\ntheir findings and offered to turn over the body to them. But when the\njournalists returned to the morgue with a car and a coffin, they found\nthat the state prosecutor had already removed the corpse and\ntransported it to Kyiv for DNA testing. In late November, the\nprosecutor's office launched a half-hearted effort to secure blood\nsamples from Gongadze's family, only obtaining the samples in\nmid-December.\n\nOn November 28, Oleksandr Moroz, the leader of the Socialist Party and\na longtime rival of President Kuchma, released tape recordings of what\nhe claimed were conversations between Kuchma, Presidential Chief of\nStaff Vladimir Litvin, and Interior Minister Yury Kravchenko. On the\ntape, three male voices discuss various ways of \"dealing\" with\nGongadze. In casual, profanity-laced tones, they discuss undercover\nsurveillance, deporting him back to his native Georgia, prosecuting him\nin Ukraine, or having a group of Chechens kidnap him. The speakers are\nclearly concerned about Gongadze's journalism. \"You give me this same\none at Ukrainska Pravda and we will start to decide what to do with him,\" one says. \"He's simply gone too far.\"\n\nMoroz claimed he had received the tapes in mid-October from an unnamed\nformer officer of the Special Communication Detachment of Ukraine's\nState Security Service (SBU) who was responsible for communications\nsecurity within President Kuchma's office, the Kyiv Post\nreported. Moroz said he had delayed releasing the tapes until late\nNovember in order to have them authenticated by foreign experts, and to\ngive the source's family time to leave the country.\n\nIn early December, three Ukrainian Parliament deputies traveled to an\nundisclosed European Union country and videotaped their meeting with\nthe officer, who was identified as Mykola Melnychenko, a 34-year-old\nmajor. On the video, Major Melnychenko claims that he secretly recorded\nKuchma's conversations by placing a digital audio recorder under a sofa\nin the president's office. Melnychenko justifies his actions by saying,\n\"I gave my oath of allegiance to Ukraine, to the people of Ukraine. I\ndid not break my oath. I did not swear allegiance to Kuchma to perform\nhis criminal orders.\"\n\nAt year's end, the tapes had not yet been authenticated by a neutral\nthird party. But it seemed credible for several reasons, according to a\nCPJ source close to the investigation who did not wish to be\nidentified. The informal manner of speaking and frequent use of\nexpletives match Kuchma's conversational style. Also, researchers from\nthe Dutch Institute of Applied Scientific Research, hired by a Dutch\ntabloid to evaluate the tapes, concluded that the recordings had not\nbeen doctored, although they were unable to identify the voices\nconclusively, the Kyiv Post\nreported. And while Moroz was a bitter rival of Kuchma, he was known to\nbe relatively cautious in making accusations against other politicians,\nparticularly the president.\n Kuchma flatly denied\nthat he had anything to do with Gongadze's disappearance and described\nthe Moroz tape as a \"provocation,\" according to the ITAR-TASS news\nagency.\n\nThe government's agitated response to the scandal only fueled public\nsuspicion. A presidential spokesman denied Moroz's allegations on the\nsame day that he made them. Meanwhile, a local prosecutor announced he\nwas launching a criminal investigation into Moroz's alleged \"insults\nand slander\" against President Kuchma.\n\nOn December 4, just as the allegations against Kuchma were gaining\nmomentum, Kyiv police announced that Gongadze had died in an attempted\nrobbery. But by then, public confidence in the investigation had\ndwindled to a point where some opposition politicians were even\nquestioning whether the body being examined in Kyiv was the same corpse\nthat was found in Tarashcha.\n\nOn December 18, Gongadze's wife, Myroslava, identified the jewelry\nfound by the body in Tarashcha as belonging to her husband. And\nalthough the corpse was badly decomposed, she claimed to recognize her\nhusband's foot.\n\nIn late December, German forensic experts determined that the corpse\nfound in Tarashcha was indeed Gongadze's, according to the German news\nagency Deutsche Presse-Agentur. The Ukrainian government promised to\nconduct DNA tests but had not yet done so by early January."},{"id":612,"location":"Georgia","year":"2001","name":"Georgy Sanaya","organization":"Rustavi-2","date":"July 26, 2001","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Tbilisi","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Sanaya, a popular 26-year-old Georgian journalist, was found dead in\nhis Tbilisi apartment.

Ortega, 47, had recently received death threats from an unknown source, according to The Associated Press. The journalist had openly criticized local officials accused of corruption and had opposed provincial mining projects, news reports said.\nIn a departure from most journalist murder investigations in the Philippines, police moved quickly in the case, arresting Marlon Recamata, the alleged gunman, and several suspected accomplices. Recamata pleaded guilty in February 2011 and was sentenced to life in prison in May 2013. Recamata told the court he was paid the equivalent of US$250 for the slaying, according to news reports and the victim's family.\nAn accomplice, Rodolfo Edrad, identified ex-Palawan provincial governor, Joel Reyes, and his brother, Mario Reyes, former mayor of the resort town of Coron in northern Palawan, as having ordered the murder in retaliation for Ortega's reporting on local mining operations. A Department of Justice panel had dismissed murder charges against the Reyes brothers in 2011, but a second panel reversed that decision in March 2013, based on new evidence. The following month, an appellate court blocked efforts by the Department of Justice to arrest the Reyeses, saying the department was over-reaching, according to news reports. While the department appealed, the brothers went into hiding.\nThe case has been marred in other respects. In February 2013, an accomplice who became a prosecution witness was found dead in his prison cell in Lucena City, Quezon. Prison authorities said Dennis Aranas had hanged himself, but an investigation by the public attorney's office found fingernail marks and other injuries that indicated he had likely been attacked.\nPolice in Phuket, Thailand arrested both Reyes brothers, both of whom were traveling on fake passports, for overstaying their visas. They were deported to the Philippines, where they were held in detention, according to news reports. In January 2016, the Supreme Court ruled that there was probable cause for their arrest, and returned jurisdiction for the case to Palawan's Regional Trial Court. In March 2016, Arturo \"Nonoy\" Regalado, a former aide to the governor, was found guilty by the court for his role in Ortega's assassination and sentenced to 40 years in prison.\nIn a controversial decision, the regional court granted bail to Mario Reyes in May 2016, but later in the year rejected a similar petition for Joel Reyes. Both politicians ran for elected office from prison but lost their respective bids for the vice-mayoralty and mayoralty of Coron on May 9, according to news reports. The murder trial was still in progress in late 2016."},{"id":618,"location":"Cameroon","year":"2010","name":"Germain Cyrille Ngota Ngota","organization":"Cameroon express","date":"April 22, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Dangerous Assignment","specificlocation":"Yaoundé","job":"Editor","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","description":"Ngota, 38, editor of the private bimonthly Cameroon Express, died in his cell in Kondengui Prison, where he was being held on charges of falsifying a government document.  He had been arrested in February based on a criminal complaint from top presidential aide Laurent Esso.\nThe case began when Ngota and journalists with three other publications jointly sent a series of questions to Esso, secretary-general of the presidency and chairman of the state-run oil company SNH, along with a copy of a document that had been leaked to them. Their questions centered on whether 1.3 billion CFA francs (US$2.6 million) had been improperly paid to three SNH managers as \"commissions\" in the purchase of an offshore service ship, according to news reports and CPJ interviews. The accompanying document purported to be a June 2008 confidential memorandum signed by Esso that described the payments. (Esso did not publicly comment on the allegations and did not respond to CPJ's requests for a response.)\nOn February 5, intelligence agents arrested Ngota along with Harrys Robert Mintya of the weekly Le Devoir, Serge Sabouang of the bimonthly La Nation, and reporter Simon Hervé Nko'o of the weekly Bebela. Agents with the Directorate-General of External Intelligence pressed the journalists for their source of the 2008 memo, holding them each for several days, the journalists later told colleagues. By February 25, news reports said, judicial police had charged the journalists with falsifying a government document. Nko'o had gone into hiding by that time, but the others were rearrested and sent to Kondengui Prison.\nNgota died on April 22 from \"abandonment, improper care\" and the authorities' \"failure to render assistance,\" according to a prison doctor's initial death certificate, which his family shared with local journalists. A 15-year veteran of the press, Ngota was the first journalist to lose his life in the line of duty in Cameroon since CPJ began documenting media casualties in 1992.\nCPJ and other groups immediately called for an independent investigation into the death. President Paul Biya did order a judicial police inquiry \"independent of the executive\" but appeared to immediately predetermine its result. Biya asserted the case was \"not a matter of restriction of freedom of the press,\" according to news reports, and that Ngota had died of poor health. The ensuing government inquiry was riddled with irregularities.\nJust two days after Biya's announcement, Communications Minister Issa Tchoroma Bakary said Ngota had tested positive for HIV and had died from its complications--a claim disputed by Ngota's widow. Tchoroma said the findings were based on a second medical examination of Ngota's body, which he said had been held in the presence of the journalist's family--a claim denied by Ngota's brother, Bruno Ntede, according to Agence France-Presse. Félix Cyriaque Ebolé Bola, a local journalist invited by the government to be an independent witness at the examination, told CPJ that he had been given the wrong address and didn't make it to the exam.\nIn September, Justice Minister Amadou Ali presented the findings of his agency's inquiry into the death, which absolved authorities of any responsibility. The National Union of Cameroonian Journalists and Ngota's family criticized the investigation as opaque--relatives were never consulted or apprised of its progress--and inherently conflicted because the same judicial police conducting the inquiry were involved in the initial arrests of the four journalists."},{"id":619,"location":"Democratic Republic of the Congo","year":"2014","name":"Germain Kennedy Mumbere Muliwavyo","organization":"Radio télévision muungano","date":"February 16, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Oïcha","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Radio, Television","coverage":"Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Muliwavyo, 28,\ndied of gunshot wounds he sustained after the Congolese military vehicle he was\nriding was ambushed in North Kivu by the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan rebel\ngroup operating in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to news reports. \nMuliwavyo, a\nreporter of the Radio Télévision Muungano station based in the town of\nOïcha, was headed to report on the village of Kamango, which the Congolese\nnational armed forces had retaken from Ugandan rebels the day before,\naccording to Congolese press freedom group Journaliste En Danger (JED).

When Rivas exited his car, an unidentified gunman shot him in the head and fled.The police suspect that several accomplices were waiting for the hit man in a car, according to the Tegucigalpa daily El Heraldo. Police are pursuing several possible motives in the investigation, including that Rivas was killed for his journalistic work. Authorities have identified three individuals who allegedly committed the murder, but arrest warrants for the suspects have not yet been issued, the Tegucigalpa daily La Prensa reported.In addition to his duties as owner of Corporación Maya Visión, Rivas was the director of the daily news program \"CMV Noticias\" (CMV News). The program, which is broadcast between 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m., also airs on radio station Estéreo Maya Visión, which Rivas and his wife own.Before he was murdered, Rivas survived a shooting on February 24. That evening, unidentified assailants attacked the journalist outside his house when he arrived home after finishing his station's daily news program, he told CPJ after the incident. When Rivas exited the car to open the garage door, the attacker, who was hidden, fired a single shot and fled. The shot missed Rivas, hitting the pavement. Rivas then went into his house and called the police, who arrived about 20 minutes later. Officers examined the area but left soon because it became too dark to search. Two people, including a neighborhood guard, witnessed the attack.The next day, Rivas and the neighborhood guard looked for evidence, found a gun that appeared to have been used in the shooting, and turned it over to police. Officers told Rivas it was a .30-caliber weapon. They sent it to a lab in the capital, Tegucigalpa, for ballistic tests. The test results were never announced, and the weapon used in the attack remains in a Tegucigalpa lab.The journalist told CPJ he believed that the attack was linked to his journalistic work and cited several sensitive stories that his station had covered. In September 2002, the station's investigative journalism team reported on the smuggling of coffee and cattle from Honduras to Guatemala. (The segment was dropped in December 2002 after the sponsor canceled its contract.) The station has also extensively covered local neighborhood associations that have denounced a local mining company for spilling cyanide into Copán Department's Lara River. The night of the February attack, Rivas said, the station reported that the Honduran government had ordered the mining company to pay a fine of 1 million lempiras (US$60,000).Félix Molina, deputy coordinator of the Honduran freedom of expression organization Comité para la Libertad de Expresión, said that although the station's crime reporting was not very aggressive, the fact that it covered crime at all could have provoked retaliation.Rivas, who said he had no enemies, did not have any particular suspects for the February shooting. The day after the attack, he filed a complaint with the General Department of Criminal Investigations, part of the Ministry of Security. Rivas complained that the police had not offered the protection he requested."},{"id":621,"location":"Syria","year":"2013","name":"Ghaith Abd al-Jawad","organization":"Qaboun media center","date":"March 10, 2013","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Damascus","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Al-Jawad\ndocumented clashes and protests for the Qaboun Media\nCenter, a group of opposition citizen journalists who film clashes in the neighborhood of Qaboun and publish the\nunattributed videos online, according to international broadcaster Al-Jazeera\nand the local press freedom group Syrian Journalists Association. \nAl-Jawad,\nwho was known locally as \"Abu Teem,\" was killed with Amr Badir al-Deen\nJunaid, the head of the Qaboun Media Center, by a\nmortar shell fired by pro-Assad forces in Qaboun, according to Shaam News\nNetwork and other reports.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":635,"location":"Brazil","year":"2015","name":"Gleydson Carvalho","organization":"Radio liberdade fm 90.3","date":"August 6, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Camocim","description":"Carvalho was shot dead by two men as he was presenting his afternoon radio show in the town of Camocim in the northern state of Ceará.

Jiménez covered crime and security for the newspapers Notisur and Liberal del Sur and had reported on local abductions and violence toward migrants, according to local journalists. The journalist sometimes used the pseudonym \"The Panther\" for security reasons, according to news reports.\nDays after finding Jiménez's body, authorities said one of the bodies found buried with him belonged to an abducted union leader whose disappearance the journalist had covered, according to news reports.\nVeracruz authorities announced they had five suspects in custody and were searching for others. One of the detainees, José Luis Márquez Hernández, who went by the name \"El Pony,\" allegedly confessed to being the leader of the group that tortured and killed the journalist, according to reports. Authorities also identified one of the detainees as Teresa de Jesús Hernández Cruz, the owner of a local bar and a neighbor of Jiménez, who they said had ordered the crime for 20,000 pesos (US$1,500) because of a personal dispute, according to news reports.\nThe Veracruz state chief of staff, Erick Lagos, initially told the daily Milenio that the murder was a matter of personal revenge and had no link to Jiménez's journalism. Local journalists told CPJ that they were disturbed by how quickly local authorities had moved to rule out any journalism-related motive in the case. State spokeswoman Gina Domínguez then backtracked and told reporters that authorities had not ruled out any motive and that they were investigating, but that they were principally looking into the theory of a personal dispute.\nSandra Segura, a journalist with the local daily Notiver, along with another journalist who asked to remain anonymous, cast doubt on the official version of the crime. Segura told CPJ that as part of his recent investigation into violence against migrants, Jiménez had written an article about the kidnapping of two migrants at a local bar. News reports conflicted as to whether the bar mentioned in the story was the same one owned by Hernández Cruz.\nCristina Hernández, the journalist's wife, told Milenio that she believed the bar owner had ordered the murder in retaliation for an article Jiménez had published about a stabbing that occurred near her bar and because of a personal dispute between their daughters. The journalist's daughters later testified that the bar owner had threatened their father because of the article about the stabbing, according to news reports.\nThe journalist's daughters said Hernández and her bar had ties to the larger activities of the feared organized crime group Los Zetas, according to reports citing family statements. Segura also questioned the plausibility of Hernández having hired so many people to participate in the crime and the relatively small amount of money allegedly involved.\nOn February 13, several of the detainees, who were denied bail, said in a hearing that they had previously confessed to the crime under torture by law enforcement officials, according to news reports.\nTwo days later, the state Attorney General Felipe Amadeo Flores Espinosa said that several international and local human rights and journalist groups, including CPJ, would be granted access to the files in the investigation, which he emphasized was ongoing and would include the journalist's work as a possible motive.\nOn the weekend of February 15, a group of journalists and representatives from local and international free press organizations, calling itself the \"Observation Mission,\" traveled to Veracruz, spoke with local authorities, and requested that the federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression take jurisdiction for the case.\nDays after the mission, in the face of sustained criticism, both Flores and Domínguez resigned from their positions, although officials denied it was related to Jiménez's murder. CPJ was told by the incoming Attorney General's office that it would still have access to the files on the murder.\nVeracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for the press, according to CPJ research. Since 2011, at least two journalists have been killed in Veracruz in relation to their work, according to CPJ research. CPJ is investigating the deaths of at least six others in unclear circumstances. At least three journalists have disappeared in the state in the same time period.

Since then, he worked as managing editor for the independent daily Al-Mashriq and the now-defunct weekly Al-Wihda al-Wataniya. He was the editor-in-chief of the now-defunct weekly Iraqiyoun. In 2005, Sarhan became the managing editor of Baghdad's municipal secretariat weekly Sawt Baghdad. He later became a public relations director for the secretariat.\nSarhan freelanced for several national and international Arabic-language newspapers, including the Iraqi dailies Azzaman and Al-Mashriq, according to the CPJ source. He also appeared as an analyst on several programs for Iraqi satellite channels such as Al-Baghdadia and Al-Sharqiya. He regularly wrote articles and reports for Sawt Baghdad as part of his job for the secretariat, the source said.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":675,"location":"Somalia","year":"1993","name":"Hansi Krauss","organization":"Associated press","date":"July 12, 1993","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Mogadishu","job":"Photographer","medium":"Print","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Mob Violence","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Krauss, a German photographer with the Associated Press; Hosea Maina, a Kenyan photographer working for Reuters; Dan Eldon, photographer holding British and American passports and working for Reuters; and Anthony Macharia, a Kenyan soundman working for Reuters, were killed when a crowd, angered by a the death of more than 70 Somalis in an aerial attack on General Mohamed Farah Aidid's command post, set upon them wielding rocks, clubs, and guns.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of\nbarbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies\nwere dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan.\nA\nfact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino\nJournalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews,\nand the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of\nthe victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio\nand television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of\njournalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos,\nKoronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims\nwere married and had children.\nThe entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political\nleader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been\nwarned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but\ninstead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go\nalong, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be\nattacked, according to local and foreign media reports.\nPolice quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu\nUnsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind\nthe killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence.\nInvestigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted\nthe group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters\nquoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both\nbullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind\ntheir backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other\nsources reported.\nThe journalists were not directly targeted for their work,\nbut were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans\ncompeting for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s\ndecades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army.\nIn\ntheir fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of\nconcerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime\nscene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still\nstrewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied\non the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The\nreport also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a\nnumber of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into\nsilence. \nThe\nreport, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were\nburied might have been dug several days before the massacre.\nThe\nmassacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian\nArmed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed\nto have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot\nthat would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said.\nNo\nsingle event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ\nbegan compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest\nprior event for the press came in Iraq\non October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in\nan attack at the station’s Baghdad\nstudios."},{"id":704,"location":"Honduras","year":"2010","name":"Henry Suazo","organization":"Radio hrn, Cablevisión del atlántico","date":"December 28, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"La Masica","freelance":"No","description":"Suazo, correspondent for Tegucigalpa-based Radio HRN and\nnews presenter for Cablevisión del Atlántico, was shot as he was leaving his home,\naccording to news reports.

Dink had received numerous death threats from nationalist Turks who viewed his iconoclastic journalism, particularly on the mass killings of Armenians in the early 20th century, as an act of treachery. In a January 10 article in Agos, Dink said he had passed along a particularly threatening letter to Istanbul's Sisli district prosecutor, but no action had been taken.\nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned Dink's murder as an attack against Turkey's unity and promised to catch those responsible, according to international news reports. A day later, police arrested the alleged triggerman, 17-year-old Ogün Samast, who reportedly confessed to the crime. Erhan Tuncel and Yasin Hayal, described as ultranationalist Turks opposed to Dink's political views, were accused of conspiring with Samast to carry out the murder. In all, 19 people went on trial beginning in July.\nIn the last 15 years, 18 other Turkish journalists have been killed for their work, many of them murdered, making it the eighth-deadliest country in the world for journalists, CPJ research shows. The last killing was in 1999. More recently, journalists, academics, and others have been subjected to pervasive legal harassment for statements that allegedly insult the Turkish identity, CPJ research shows.\nDink, a Turkish citizen of Armenian descent, had been prosecuted several times in recent years-for writing about the mass killings of Armenians by Turks at the beginning of the 20th century, for criticizing lines in the Turkish national anthem that he considered discriminatory, and even for commenting publicly on the court cases against him. His office had also been the target of protests.\nIn July 2006, Turkey's High Court of Appeals upheld a six-month suspended prison sentence against Dink for violating Article 301 of the penal code in a case sparked by complaints from nationalist activists. His prosecution stemmed from a series of articles in early 2004 dealing with the collective memory of the Armenian massacres of 1915-17 under the Ottoman Empire. Armenians call the killings the first genocide of the 20th century, a term that Turkey rejects.\nIronically, the pieces for which Dink was convicted had urged diaspora Armenians to let go of their anger against the Turks. The prosecution was sharply criticized by the European Union, which Turkey has sought to join. Dink said he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, to clear his name.\nDink edited Agos for all of the newspaper's 11-year existence.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":738,"location":"Turkey","year":"2015","name":"Ibrahim Abd al-Qader","organization":"Eye on the homeland, Raqqa is being slaughtered silently","date":"October 30, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Urfa","job":"Editor","medium":"Print, Internet","coverage":"Corruption, Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Syrian journalist Ibrahim Abd al-Qader was killed along with his colleague Fares Hamadi in an apartment in Urfa, southeastern Turkey, on October 30, 2015. Abd al-Qader was the executive director of Eye on the Homeland, a Syrian news website, according to a statement on the group's Facebook page, and also worked for Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, a Syrian citizen journalist group.A member of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently told CPJ that Abd Al-Qader had been an early member of their group. The murders occurred a few weeks before CPJ was to recognize Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently with its annual International Press Freedom Award.Supporters of the militant group Islamic State published a video on social media claiming responsibility two days after the murders. Text in the video said Islamic State murdered Abd al-Qader and Hamadi to warn all \"apostates [that] they will be slaughtered silently,\" mocking the name of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently. The video ends with footage of Hamadi's body, which had a deep gash that had nearly severed the neck. Abd al-Qader's body was not shown in the video.In an interview with NBC, published on November 2, 2015, Abd al-Qader's brother, Ahmed, who is one of the founders of Eye on the Homeland, accused a Syrian named Tlas Surur of murdering his brother and colleague. Ahmed Abd al-Qader said Surur arrived from Raqqa more than a month before the murder, claiming to have defected from Islamic State. But the story was a ruse to gain the journalists' trust, he said. On the night of the murder, Surur invited Ibrahim Abd al-Qader and Hamadi to his apartment across the street from where they lived. Surur was waiting with two accomplices, who have not been publicly identified, and the apartment's windows had been covered to hide the attack from onlookers, Ahmed Abd al-Qader said. He added that he believes Surur fled to Syria after the murder.According to Turkish media reports published the week after the murders, police found three footprints in blood and camera footage of one of the suspects. One police source, who was not named, told NBC that evidence implicated Surur in the murders.Since the start of the conflict, numerous Syrian journalists have operated independent media outlets in Turkey, including Eye on the Homeland. The Turkish authorities have largely allowed these outlets to report on Syria without harassment but Syrian journalists have repeatedly told CPJ they face restrictions on reporting on events inside Turkey and fear the Turkish government is not doing enough to protect them from potential threats emanating from Syria. Members of Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently and Eye on the Homeland told CPJ they receive death threats on a daily basis for their reporting on Islamic State.Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, one of the few reliable and independent sources of news left in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, was established in April 2014.

Abu Zahra's colleague Said Dahla, a photographer for the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, told CPJ that at around 2 p.m., the sound of tanks coming toward the area led residents to flee or take cover inside nearby businesses or residences.\n\n Together, Dahla and Abu Zahra went into the middle of Faisal Street to photograph an Israeli armored personnel carrier (APC) that had slammed into an electricity pole there. Dahla said that he and Abu Zahra were alone in the street at this point facing two Israeli tanks (near the APC), which he estimated to be about 40 meters (45 yards) in front of them.\n\n Both men were holding cameras, according to Dahla, and Dahla wore a flak jacket clearly marked \"Press.\" Dahla said that Abu Zahra also wore a cloth vest that identified him as a member of the press.\n\n According to Dahla, moments after the two began taking photographs, gunfire erupted from the tanks. Dahla, who was hit in the leg with bullet shrapnel, said that he looked over and saw that Abu Zahra had been injured in his thigh and was bleeding profusely.\n\n Dahla said that as they tried to take shelter in a nearby building, the tanks continued to fire on them. Dahla told CPJ that the two journalists remained in the building entrance, unable to get to a hospital. He estimates that more than 25 minutes passed before Abu Zahra was helped into a taxi and taken to Jenin Hospital, where he died on July 12.\n\n According to an Israeli army spokesperson, after the APC hit the electricity pole on the afternoon of July 11, a mob attacked the personnel carrier with Molotov cocktails and rocks, and people in the crowd fired on the tanks. The spokesperson said the soldiers in the tanks responded by firing back at the source of the gunfire.\n\n However, witnesses who were at the city center at the time told CPJ that residents did not attack the tanks until after the two journalists had been shot. Photos of the stranded APC taken by Dahla before the shooting show no signs of clashes or hostile action near the carrier.

The following narrative is drawn from CPJ interviews with Safronov's Kommersant colleagues and military experts, and from press reports.\nOn the day he died, Safronov talked to colleagues and family by phone and made plans with them for later in the day and for the following week. He visited a Moscow doctor for treatment of an ulcer, symptoms of which had recently abated. Safronov then went grocery shopping and took a trolley back home. Around 4 p.m., two university students living in a nearby apartment building heard a thud and saw Safronov on the ground and an open window in the building above. Safronov's groceries were on the landing between the fourth and the fifth floor of his apartment building. He died before help arrived.\nThe Taganka prosecutor's office in Moscow initially said the death was a suicide. Several days later, prosecutors opened an investigation into what they called \"incitement to suicide,\" a provision of the Russian penal code that is defined as someone provoking a suicide through threats or abusive treatment. In September, prosecutors returned to their initial theory and declared the killing a suicide.\nCPJ research shows Safronov had worked on a number of sensitive issues:\n• In late February, Safronov had returned from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, where he had covered the annual International Defense Exhibition and Conference, a gathering of defense manufacturers. Colleagues said Safronov had called the newsroom from Abu Dhabi with information about a purported Russian sale of fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to Syria and Iran. The sale was said to be channeled through Belarus to conceal the origin. Safronov had planned to finish the story when he returned.\n• Three days before his death, Safronov privately told colleagues at a news conference that he had information about an alleged Russian sale to Syria of the surface-to-air missile system Pantsir-S1, the fighter aircraft MiG-29, and the tactical missile Iskandar-E. He said he had been cautioned not to publish the information because of its international implications, but he did not say who had issued the warning.\n• Safronov had been interrogated many times by state security agents for allegedly disclosing state secrets in his articles. He was never formally charged because he was able to demonstrate that he had relied solely on public sources. In December 2006, Safronov angered authorities when he wrote about the third consecutive launch failure of the Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile.\nRelatives, friends, and colleagues said Safronov had no reason to commit suicide. He had no personal enemies, no debts, and no life-threatening disease. He had been married for many years, had two adult children, and was expecting his first grandchild. He did not leave a suicide note."},{"id":788,"location":"Brazil","year":"2015","name":"Ivanildo Viana","organization":"100.5 fm lider","date":"February 27, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Paraíba","freelance":"No","description":"Unidentified assailants on a motorcycle pursued Viana, who was on his own motorcycle, and shot him several times, news reports said citing police.

Garzón's colleagues informed CPJ that the journalist had scheduled a meeting with Castaño for August 14, the day after he was killed. The AUC denied responsibility for Garzón's death, and it remains unclear who ordered the murder. While some local journalists blame the AUC, others blame drug traffickers or the military. The likely motive would have been Garzón's contacts with left-wing guerrilla forces.\nBefore launching his career as a journalist and satirist 10 years ago, Garzón served as an elected official in Sumapaz, a region near Bogotá that is dominated by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Colombia's largest leftist guerrilla movement. More recently, Garzón used his stature as a well-respected broadcaster to negotiate for the release of victims of guerrilla kidnappings. He also served on an independent commission that was mediating between the government and the National Liberation Army (ELN), another leftist guerrilla movement, and was scheduled to meet with imprisoned ELN members.\nThe gunman who shot Garzón allegedly belonged to a criminal band known as La Terraza. Castaño admits he has hired La Terraza to carry out a number of crimes in recent years, including kidnappings. The official government charge sheet accuses him of hiring La Terraza to kill Garzón.

Before his death, Kuciak had worked with the Sarajevo-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Aktuality on an investigation into an Italian mafia group, ‘Ndragheta, and their incursions into Slovakia, the OCCRP said in a statement. At the time of his death, the journalist was collecting records on men considered by Italian police to be extremely dangerous, the OCCRP stated. The OCCRP has since published the uncompleted version of Kuciak’s article, which alleged embezzlement of EU funds.Police in Slovakia said March 1 that they had detained three businessmen named in the report, The Washington Post reported.Separately, the journalist’s last story for Aktuality, on February 9, looked at suspected tax fraud linked to a luxury apartment complex in Bratislava, Reuters reported. Kuciak had previously reported to police that he had received threats last year from Marian Kocner, a businessperson about whom Kuciak had written, according to The Associated Press. “It has been 44 days since I filed a criminal complaint…for the threats.

He was 50 years old.\nAccording to news reports and statements by Sinaloa state Attorney General Juan José Rios, Valdez was shot around noon, shortly after he left the offices of Riodoce. Unknown assailants blocked his way, dragged him out of his car and shot him at least 12 times. Valdez died shortly after. The attackers fled in his vehicle, which was later found abandoned not far from the scene of the crime, state and federal authorities told CPJ in the days following the murder. They also told CPJ that Valdez's laptop computer and mobile phone had been taken.\nRiodoce magazine focuses mostly on organized crime, corruption, and regional politics.\nValdez was also the correspondent in Sinaloa for La Jornada, a Mexico City-based newspaper, and gained widespread national recognition for authoring a series of books that chronicle the Mexican underworld and the victims of Mexico's drug war. He was a 2011 recipient of CPJ's International Press Freedom Award.\nAs one of the few investigative magazines in the state of Sinaloa, Riodoce and its reporters have been a frequent target of threats and sometimes of violence, according to news reports and its reporters. Sinaloa is the home state of some of Mexico's most notorious drug lords and the base of operations of Sinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's oldest and most powerful drug trafficking organizations. Since its inception, the magazine's fearless reporting, has often placed it at odds with powerful criminal and political interests, according to media reports. In 2009, a grenade was thrown at one of its editorial offices, but no one was hurt, according to news reports.\nJavier Valdez told CPJ in March 2017 that he was concerned for his safety. His newspaper La Jornada reported one day after his murder that he had received anonymous death threats since February, without specifying their nature. Several reporters who knew the victim well and who spoke with CPJ on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation could not confirm the threats. They did, however, say that the situation in the state had become \"tense\" after the January 2016 arrest and extradition to the United States of Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the alleged founder of the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzmán's extradition has been widely cited in media reports as the immediate cause of a surge in violence in the state in recent months.\nRicardo Sánchez Pérez del Pozo, the Special Prosecutor for Crimes against Freedom of Expression (FEADLE) told CPJ in May 2017 that his office had taken charge of the investigation, with support from the Sinaloa state prosecutor's office. He emphasized to CPJ on several occasions that the victim's work as a journalist was the principal line of investigation.\nAt a press conference on April 24, 2018, police named the alleged accomplice to the 2017 murder as 26-year-old Heriberto 'N', alias \"El Koala,\" and said that Valdez was killed for his reporting.

Lopes was at his home in Edealina, a town of around 4,000 people, when two men with motorcycles shot him dead as he was watching television, police and news reports said.  Friends and colleagues told CPJ and the local news site Globo that Lopes, who was frequently critical of local politicians on his radio show, faced threats and other forms of intimidation for more than a year before his murder. Lopes, 39, worked as a radio presenter for Beira Rio FM, an Edealina-based station that is owned by a political rival to Edealina's current mayor, a police spokesperson told CPJ. According to the spokesperson who was not authorized to give his name, Lopes frequently criticized the incumbent on air. The station director Cristina Leandro confirmed to CPJ that Lopes was a sharp and constant critic of local politicians, and devoted much of his daily one-hour show, Voz do Povo (Voice of the People), to highlighting what he saw as corruption or poor administration by local politicians.Marlon Queiroz, Lopes' co-host and a station DJ, told the Globo TV station that Lopes regularly received threats.\"For two years now he's been getting threats, daily threats via WhatsApp-- messages saying I'm going to end your family, that kind of thing,\" Queiroz said.Leandro told CPJ Lopes' house was shot up in the fall of 2016. Several months later after Lopes had been criticizing a local politician on air, her husband put a gun to Lopes' head and told him to stop, according to Leandro.According to Leandro, Lopes reported this incident to police, and pressed charges against the man who put a gun to his head. However, the accused never showed up to court and the case stymied, Leandro said.In a separate incident, the building where Beira Rio FM is based was also set on fire in November 2017, the second such arson attack in a year.State police told CPJ officers from five different groups have been sent to the area to help with the investigation, but they refused to release further details.\"Because he works on the radio he has enemies in the city but we haven't yet been able to determine who the killer was,\" Queops Barreto, the state police officer leading the investigation, told Globo TV.\"His [Lopes'] program was controversial but that doesn't mean it was connected to his assassination,\" Barreto added. \"This will all be cleared up through investigation.\""},{"id":839,"location":"Sierra Leone","year":"1999","name":"Jenner \"J.C.\" Cole","organization":"Sky-fm","date":"January 9, 1999","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Freetown","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Radio","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Cole, an on-air broadcaster with the independent radio station SKY-FM, was abducted by Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels from his home near Sandars Street in central Freetown.

The journalists followed the fighters to a square. Islamic State fighters had made a base in a building a few hundred feet away, and its snipers were shooting into the street. Oerlemans ran across the street with some fighters to photograph the front line, ducking the sniper fire. De Rijke stayed behind. About 10 minutes later she was notified by a phone call from a Libyan contact that he had been hit, at which point she raced to the Misrata field hospital where she learned that Oerlemans had been shot dead. \nOerlemans was shot while running alone across the street, according to de Rijke's account. The shooting seemed to come from snipers in the building where Islamic State fighters had a base. At least 18 other people were killed in the fighting in Sirte that day, 10 from the Islamic State side and eight from militants fighting against them, according to news reports quoting government officials. \nOerlemans was wearing a flak jacket but one of the bullets hit him in the side of the chest, under his arm.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area.

The report by the group, which Al-Ahmad had also worked with, said he was seriously injured in the fourth blast.\nThree minutes of footage of three airstrikes taken by al-Ahmad and recovered by a colleague after his death, was posted on his press agency's YouTube channel. From minute 0.40 to 1.12, the footage shows a family escaping from a building surrounded by dust and rubble. Al-Ahmad tells the camera the mosque has been hit. At 1.35, as he interviews a man who says civilians have been targeted in the attacks, a third airstrike hits close by. Several minutes later a fourth bomb strikes and badly wounds al-Ahmad, al-Khatib said. The footage posted on YouTube does not show this explosion.\nAl-Khatib told CPJ that al-Ahmad was rushed to the Turkish border for treatment, but had died by the time the director arrived about an hour later. Activists told the media that two Syrian civil defense members and a number of civilians were injured in the attacks on Hayan that day.\nThe Shahba Press Agency and Violations Documentation Center in Syria both accused Russia of carrying out the airstrikes on Hayan. The violations center cited a Hayan-based media activist as saying the fourth airstrike on October 27, allegedly launched by Russia, struck a house in the town. Al-Ahmad, who was standing about 10 meters from the house at the time, was injured, the center said.\nThe Russian military began airstrikes on Syria in September 2015, ostensibly targeting Islamic State, Al-Qaeda and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism from the Syrian opposition and their supporters for allegedly using the strikes to target all rebels fighting the government of Bashar al-Assad, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. Human rights and civil society groups have criticized the strikes for indiscriminately targeting civilians.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry has not not responded to CPJ's emailed request for comment. The ministry published a report on October 28, 2015 saying that Russian planes made 71 combat sorties, engaging 118 \"terrorist objects,\" in the previous 24 hours including in Aleppo. Hayan was not specifically mentioned.\nSyrian state news agency SANA said government warplanes also hit Hayan on October 27, targeting \"terrorist organizations.\" The report said the \"terrorists\" the airstrikes targeted named al-Ahmad as being among those killed.

Silvestre, 59, had been seized by four men outside a La Romana hotel about an hour earlier, at 8 a.m., and forced into a Jeep, according to press reports.On August 9 and 10, the attorney general's office and national police announced they had arrested five men whom they said were involved in planning or carrying out the attack. Police seized several weapons, dozens of ammunition rounds, and 118,000 pesos (US$3,070). One suspect allegedly told investigators that the assailants had planned to abduct Silvestre and take him to the capital, Santo Domingo, but shot him when the journalist resisted. All five suspects were detained, as was a sixth man who was arrested later, press reports said.Police alleged the attack was ordered by Matías Avelino Castro, also known as Joaquín Espinal Almeyda, a hotel owner and reputed drug trafficker. Authorities said they traced Avelino Castro's alleged involvement through a rental car that was used in the attack and leased through the suspect's girlfriend. The attorney general's office accused Avelino Castro of ordering the attack in retaliation for an article in the July issue of Silvestre's magazine, La Vozde la Verdad  (Voice of the Truth). The story said a man named \"Daniel,\" an alias used by the suspect, had been implicated in the recent murder of a local businessman and his driver, authorities said.Police extradited Avelino Castro from Colombia in January 2017 to face charges in the case, according to reports. On April 10, 2018, a court convicted Avelino Castro, whom police had identified as the alleged mastermind of the killing, of being an accomplice to the murder, according to reports. The court sentenced Avelino Castro to 20 years in prison, issued a fine, and ordered him to surrender two properties and a bank account.A court in July 2015 sentenced two men-- Ángel Amed Mañón Gutiérrez and Elvin Canario de Oleo-- to 30 years in prison for carrying out the murder, according to reports. Silvestre, who hosted a CañaTV program of the same name as his magazine, had accused political figures and a priest of having involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering, press reports said. In May, a local prosecutor had filed a defamation complaint against Silvestre in connection with a television report that accused the official of having ties to drug traffickers. The journalist was jailed for several days until posting bail, according to news reports. The case was pending at the time of the murder, according to Elpidio Tolentino, a local official with the press group Colegio Dominicano de Periodistas, or CDP. Silvestre had told CDP that he had been followed by two cars that tried to intercept him on July 23.In an August 9 press conference, prosecutor Frank Soto said witnesses had accused Silvestre of accepting money from drug traffickers on occasion for not publishing incriminating information or for running stories harmful to rivals, local press reports said. Tolentino said CDP challenged authorities to \"more thoroughly investigate and to present any evidence they have supporting this claim. ... If this is true they must fully investigate it. If not, they must clean his reputation.\"In November 2013, a judge freed one of the men arrested in August, Fermín Calderón, on bail. The CDP condemned the decision, saying that Calderón, who is charged with laundering money for Avelino Castro as well as for the murder of Silvestre, is a flight risk.

At around 12 p.m., a shell hit two hotel balconies where several journalists were monitoring a battle in the vicinity. Taras Protsyuk, a Ukrainian cameraman for Reuters, was also killed in the attack\n\nAgence France-Presse reported that Couso was hit in his jaw and right leg. He was taken to Saint Raphael Hospital, where he died during surgery. Couso was married with two children.\n\nDirectly after the attack, Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, confirmed that a single shell had been fired at the hotel from a tank in response to what he said was rocket and small arms fire from the building. Journalists at the hotel deny that any gunfire had emanated from the building.\n\nA CPJ report concluded that the shelling of the hotel, while not deliberate, was avoidable since U.S. commanders knew that journalists were present in the hotel and were intent on not hitting it. The report called on the Pentagon to conduct a thorough and public investigation into the incident.\n\nOn August 12, U.S. Central Command (Centcom) issued a news release summarizing the results of its investigation into the incident. The report concluded that the tank unit that opened fire on the hotel did so \"in a proportionate and justifiably measured response.\" It called the shelling \"fully in accordance with the Rules of Engagement.\"\n\nCentcom offered some detail-consistent with CPJ's investigation-that the tank opened fire at what it believed was an Iraqi \"spotter\" directing enemy fire at U.S. troops. The release also explained that \"one 120mm tank round was fired at the suspected enemy observer position. ... It was only some time after the incident that A Company became aware of the fact that the building they fired on was the Palestine Hotel and that journalists at the hotel had been killed or injured as a result.\"\n\nHowever, the news release failed to address one of the conclusions in CPJ's report: That U.S. commanders knew that journalists were in the Palestine Hotel but failed to convey this knowledge to forces on the ground.\n\nCentcom's results, which were summarized in the release, appeared to back away from earlier charges by U.S. military officials that the tank unit was responding to hostile fire emanating from the hotel. Yet, despite considerable testimony to the contrary from several journalists in the hotel, Centcom maintains \"that the enemy used portions of the hotel as a base of operations and that heavy enemy activity was occurring in those areas in and immediately around the hotel.\"\n\nIn addition, the news release failed to provide other specific information, such as how the decision to target the hotel was made.\n\nCPJ has urged Centcom to make the full report available, but a Centcom spokesperson told CPJ the report is classified.

The journalist and owner of the newspaper La Unión had been missing since January 2. On February 5, federal investigators said their DNA tests had confirmed the body was that of Sánchez, according to news reports.\nSánchez was kidnapped from his home in the municipality of Medellín de Bravo on January 2 and his computer, camera, and other electronic materials seized, according to news reports. The journalist had founded La Unión, a small weekly print and online newspaper that often criticized city authorities, particularly the mayor, Omar Cruz Reyes, and denounced local criminal activity as well as the poor quality of basic services like garbage pickup and the absence of street lights.\nA local journalist who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal told CPJ that Sánchez had not published a print edition in months due to financial constraints. The last story published on La Unión's website dated to April 2014, according to CPJ research. In the months before his death, according to local journalists and news reports, Sánchez had posted on Facebook critical commentary about crime and the actions of the local government, links to articles, and videos. He also acted as a source for other Veracruz journalists, whom he often provided with photographs and other information.\nIn the days before Sánchez was kidnapped, the journalist posted on Facebook several photographs of protests against the governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, as well as links to articles about a recent murder. On December 13 and 14, he posted several articles, press releases, and a video regarding the formation of a neighborhood watch self-defense group in response to local crime. It wasn't clear whether Sánchez, who was also active in the group, was the author of any of the materials posted on Facebook.\nThe journalist who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that information about self-defense groups was particularly sensitive for local officials who sought to downplay shortcomings in local law enforcement. The journalist's son, Jorge Sánchez, told CPJ that his father had been threatened by the mayor in connection with his coverage of the groups.\nThe state attorney general told reporters after the crime that he had evidence pointing toward the mayor. \"I have elements to suggest the mayor's participation,\" Veracruz state attorney general Luis Ángel Bravo said.\nThe state attorney general's office said a former Veracruz police officer turned drug trafficker, Noé Rodríguez, confessed to carrying out the abduction and murder, along with five other suspects, and said he had killed Sánchez the day of the kidnapping. The suspects were allegedly told by the deputy police chief of Medellín, Martín López Meneses, to kidnap and kill Sánchez, according to the state attorney general's office's statement which cited Rodríguez. López, who was also the driver and bodyguard of Mayor Cruz, was placed under preventive detention shortly after the murder.\nRodríguez also alleged that López had received his orders from Mayor Cruz, who wanted the journalist to be \"disappeared\" because he was angered by Sánchez' coverage of local crime, according to news reports. In exchange, the reports said, Cruz would allow the criminal gang to deal drugs in the area. Cruz has denied involvement in the crime and maintained that he had no disagreements with Sánchez, according to news reports.\nIn March 2015, the Veracruz state legislature voted to strip Cruz of the immunity from prosecution granted to him as an elected official. Cruz faces charges related to the murder, but has not yet been arrested according to reports.\nIn November 2015, López was released from prison after a federal judge accepted his appeal on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to keep him in jail, according to press reports and a press release from Luis Ángel Bravo Contreras, the attorney general of Veracruz. The charges against him were not dropped, reports said.\nIn the days after the kidnapping, Governor Duarte referred to Sánchez as an \"activist and taxi driver,\" which drew complaints from local journalists that the governor was trying to minimize Sánchez's work as journalist.\nVeracruz is one of the most dangerous states in Mexico for the press. In the past, Governor Duarte's government has sought to dismiss any possible link between journalists' murders and their profession."},{"id":908,"location":"Peru","year":"2011","name":"José Oquendo Reyes","organization":"Radio alas peruanas, Btv canal 45","date":"September 14, 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Pueblo Nuevo","freelance":"No","description":"Oquendo was shot five times at close range by unidentified\nmen on a motorcycle outside his home in Pueblo Nuevo in the southern region of\nChincha, local news reports said.

The murder was believed to have taken place earlier on the night Ramírez's body was discovered.Police later announced that they had found eight bags of marijuana in the trunk of Ramírez's car. The journalist's colleagues and Ciudad Juárez mayor Gustavo Elizondo publicly vouched for Ramírez's integrity, however, and said there was no indication that he had been involved in illicit activity. Local journalists claimed the drugs had been planted, perhaps by the killer or killers, to suggest that Ramírez was involved in the drug trade.Ramírez began his career with the radio stations 860 and FM Globo. He then worked as a print reporter with the Ciudad Juárez daily El Norte before taking a job with Radio Net. His daily news show, \"Juárez Hoy,\" had been on the air for about a month when he died. Broadcast from Monday to Friday, the hour-long program featured breaking news and interviews with politicians, business leaders, and others.While the case was referred to the Federal Attorney's Office, which handles all drug-related offenses, there was also speculation that Ramírez was killed for his coverage of the local sex industry. And there was some reason to suspect that he was not killed for his journalism, since local sources also suggested that he had worked as a government informant.CPJ published an alert about the murder on May 1.

He was 32 years old. Ortega, photographer Paúl Rivas and their driver Efrain Segarra were abducted on March 26, 2018, by a dissident drug trafficking group in the Ecuadoran border village of Mataje, while on assignment documenting drug-related border violence for El Comercio, according to news reports.In a news conference in Quito on April 13, Ecuadoran President Lenín Moreno confirmed that Ortega, Rivas and Segarra, had been killed by their captors earlier that week. Moreno's announcement followed several contradictory statements by the Colombian and Ecuadoran governments about the state of the hostages and whether they were being held in Colombia or Ecuador, according to the Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom.Ortega had worked for El Comercio for six years, primarily covering politics, crime, and human rights, as well as feature stories on topics like the deportation of Cuban nationals from Quito and disappeared persons in Ecuador according to the newspaper. In February 2018 Ortega wrote several articles investigating security threats, displacement and drug trafficking near Ecuador’s border with Colombia, the region where he and his coworkers were later abducted. Colombian and Ecuadoran officials on March 27 said that a group of cocaine traffickers led by the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) member Walter Arizala, known as \"Guacho,\" took the crew hostage, according to El Comercio.On April 3, Bogotá's RCN TV station broadcast a video of the three press workers shackled together in chains and padlocks looking distraught. In the video, Ortega says that the group's captors wanted to carry out a prisoner exchange and urged Moreno to comply with their demands. \"Mr. President, our lives are in your hands,\" Ortega said.On April 11, RCN received a communiqué which stated that it was from Arizala's group, saying that the all three had been killed amid a military operation. The next day, RCN TV received photos that appeared to show that the three press workers had been shot dead. At the news conference in Quito on April 13, Polivio Vinueza, head of Ecuador's national police anti-kidnapping and extortion unit, said that his government had been in contact with Arizala's group via sporadic WhatsApp messages between March 26 and April 7 and that Arizala demanded the release of three members of his group, including his sister-in-law who are imprisoned in Quito.Arizala's group released another communiqué on April 13, republished by the newspaper El Espectador, which stated that the hostages were killed because the Ecuadoran and Colombian governments refused to halt their military operations against Arizala's group.During the April 13 press conference, Moreno offered a US$100,000 reward for information leading to the kidnappers' capture and said that Ecuadoran authorities \"confirmed that these criminals [the kidnappers] never had the intention of handing them back safe and sound.\"Ecuadoran officials later on April 13 arrested nine alleged members of Arizala's group, which officials say is connected with the kidnapping, according to news reports.As of April 26, a full month after they were kidnapped, the bodies of the journalists and their driver were still in Colombian territory, according to President Juan Manuel Santos. News reports said the alleged kidnappers have not yet agreed to hand them over to authorities."},{"id":924,"location":"Guatemala","year":"1996","name":"Juan José Yantuche","organization":"\"tv noticias\"","date":"April 11, 1996","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Mixco","freelance":"No","description":"Yantuche, a reporter with the cable television news program \"TV Noticias,\" was shot and lay in a coma for a week in a Mixco hospital before dying on April 11.

Japanese authorities said the footage appeared to be authentic, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe vowed to \"make the terrorists pay,\" according to reports.\nA member of the militant group, who according to some news reports is the same man who murdered American freelancers James Foley and Steven Sotloff in 2014, claimed in the video that Goto, also known as Kenji Jogo, was killed in retribution for Japan's participation in a coalition set up to stop Islamic State, according to news reports. Japan was not involved in airstrikes carried out in Iraq and Syria since August, but it had offered humanitarian aid to countries fighting Islamic State.\n\nIslamic State had previously released four messages about Goto. In a video released on January 20, the group threatened to kill Goto and another Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa, unless it received a US$200 million ransom--the same sum the Japanese government had pledged in humanitarian assistance, according to news reports. On January 24, the group released a video, with an audio message purportedly narrated by Goto, saying that Yukawa had been killed and changing the ransom demand to the release of Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be Iraqi suicide bomber imprisoned in Jordan. On January 27, Islamic State released a third message, again purportedly narrated by Goto, warning that if al-Rishawi was not released within 24 hours, Goto and Muath al-Kaseasbeh, a Jordanian pilot also held captive by the group, would be killed. The following day the group distributed a final warning that if al-Rishawi was not brought to the Syrian-Turkish border by sunset on January 29, al-Kaseasbeh, would be killed immediately.\n\nIn response to the threats, Jordanian officials said they would be willing to release al-Rishawi in exchange for al-Kaseasbeh and Goto, according to news reports. In a video released on February 3, Islamic State militants killed al-Kaseasbeh by locking him in a cage and setting him alight. After the video's release Jordanian officials said, without citing evidence, that al-Kaseasbeh had been killed on January 3, weeks before the public negotiations began, according to news reports. If true, the claim brings into doubt whether a deal to release Goto and al-Kaseasbeh had been on the table. None of the publicly released messages from Islamic State explicitly offered the pilot's release.\n\nIn 1996, Goto founded Independent Press, a news website covering conflict, refugee populations, and poverty. Major Japanese outlets, including NHK World and Tokyo Broadcasting System, featured its reports. The 47-year-old journalist had covered the Syrian conflict with a focus on its humanitarian impact since the start of the civil war.\n\nHe disappeared in Syria on October 25 and on December 2 his wife, Rinko, received a message from Goto's captors confirming his kidnapping, his wife explained in a statement given to the freelancer support charity Rory Peck Trust on January 29. Rinko said in the statement that Goto \"went to Syria to show the plight of those who suffer,\" adding that she believes he \"may have also been trying to find out about Haruna Yukawa's situation.\"\n\n\nIn a video filmed in Aleppo and posted on YouTube on October 25, Goto said he planned to travel to Raqqa, the Islamic State stronghold, to \"get the story of what ISIS [Islamic State] wants to do in Syria.\" He said he understood he was entering dangerous territory and that he would take responsibility if anything happened to him. According to Japanese media reports, Goto had told friends he would be back in Japan on October 29 to speak at an event.\n\nSeveral news reports, including one that cited Goto's fixer in Syria who filmed the Aleppo video, said Goto went to Raqqa in search of Yukawa, who was abducted in August. According to Reuters, Yukawa and Goto first met in Syria in April 2014 and traveled to Iraq together in June. In August, Goto told Reuters that Yukawa needed someone with experience to help him survive combat zones.\n\nAt the request of the family, the Committee to Protect Journalists did not publicize Goto's case until the release of the January 20 video.\n\nAs with Foley and Sotloff, it is not clear where and when Islamic State murdered Goto."},{"id":955,"location":"Myanmar","year":"2007","name":"Kenji Nagai","organization":"Apf news","date":"September 27, 2007","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Dangerous Assignment","specificlocation":"Rangoon","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer","medium":"Print, Television","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Nagai, 50, who was working for the Tokyo-based video and photo agency APF News, was killed by Burmese troops cracking down on antigovernment demonstrations in Rangoon, according to official Japanese state-run television.\nNagai appeared to be deliberately targeted by a Burmese soldier, according to video footage shown on Japan's Fuji News Network.

Al-Zintani documented the involvement of the Saiqa (special forces) of the Libyan National Army in the conflict in Libya. He also sold content to local and international networks on a freelance basis.\nAl-Zintani was covering an offensive by the Saiqa against Islamist militias at the time of his death, according to his colleagues and news reports. The Saiqa's media office released a statement announcing the death of seven of its members on June 24, including al-Zintani, who was described as a media professional. Some of the work produced by the photographer, who had an unarmed role in the forces, was used internally by the Saiqa and some was used to promote the group on local channels, according to colleagues of al-Zintani.\nAfter he was hit, al-Zintani was taken to a hospital in Benghazi, where he died later that day from his injuries, Omar Altwati, a freelance producer with whom al-Zintani had worked in the week before his death, told CPJ. According to Altwati and local news reports, the sniper likely belonged to the Islamist militias fighting for territory in and around Benghazi. CPJ was unable to determine if any group took responsibility.\nThe journalist had worked for multiple Libyan outlets, including al-Zintan TV, which released a statement paying tribute to him after his death. In the weeks before his death, he had worked closely with Altwati, a freelancer who produces video and images for Sky News Arabia TV, which is part-owned by British Sky Broadcasting and has headquarters in Abu Dhabi. A spokesperson for Sky News Arabia TV told CPJ that it did not deal directly with al-Zintani. \nAltwati, the producer, told CPJ that al-Zintani had provided him with images of fighting in Gwersha earlier in June and that they communicated on June 23, the day before al-Zintani was killed. Records of text messages between the two journalists, viewed by CPJ, show that al-Zintani said on June 23 that he would cover any fighting for Altwati in the area in the coming days.\nAltwati said he did not hear from al-Zintani again and when he tried to call him on June 24, the photographer's phone was turned off. Altwati said that another journalist told him al-Zintani had been killed covering a Libyan National Army offensive that day. Altwati told CPJ that he confirmed the death with a military spokesperson, who also said al-Zintani was with a Saiqa unit at the time he was hit.\nA YouTube channel in al-Zintani's name contains videos dating back to 2012, mostly about the fighting in Libya. Videos from the past three months before his death include a report about the Libyan National Army reclaiming a cement factory in Benghazi from Islamist militias, and promotional reports about the Libyan National Army's air force. The videos are marked as filmed and produced by al-Zintani.\nAl-Zintani took up photojournalism in 2011 after the Libyan uprising against Muammar Qaddafi. Brian Conley, director of the U.S.-based company Small World News, which provides training to citizen journalists, told CPJ he met al-Zintani in Libya in 2011 when the journalist was covering fighting in the town of Zintan. He said that they met again in 2012 at a video production workshop that Conley ran in Benghazi. Conley said he helped al-Zintani sell content to U.S. television networks. The two later discussed collaborating on running workshops for young journalists in Libya, but the project never materialized, Conley said.\nBenghazi has been the scene of fierce fighting in 2016 between units belonging to the internationally recognized Libyan National Army, led by General Khalifa Haftar, and Islamist militias, some with affiliations to the militant group, Islamic State."},{"id":964,"location":"Syria","year":"2016","name":"Khaled Eissa","organization":"Freelance","date":"June 24, 2016","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Aleppo","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer","medium":"Television, Internet","coverage":"Human Rights, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Independent Syrian cameraman Khaled Eissa, 25, died in a hospital in Antakya, Turkey, on June 24, 2016, of injuries he suffered a week prior, according to his friends and news reports.\nEissa and independent Syrian journalist Hadi Abdullah were wounded by an improvised explosive device (IED) that destroyed their house in the Syrian city of Aleppo late the night of June 16, according to media reports.\nThe IED exploded at around midnight in front of Abdullah's home, where he and Eissa were staying.

Lee had been stabbed in the throat, back, and side, and the apartment door was open. According to local press reports December 26 newspapers were strewn on the floor of his apartment, suggesting that a scuffle had taken place.\nA financial and economic reporter, Lee started freelancing for BridgeNews in August 1998, and became a full time reporter five months later. Born in 1958, he had worked as a freelance and staff reporter and editor for several U.S. newspapers, including the Memphis Commercial Appeal, the Knoxville News-Sentinel, the El Paso Herald-Post, the San Antonio Express-News, and the Dallas Morning News.\nLee had recently covered the December 26 presidential elections in Guatemala, and was not known to have received threats for his work.\nColleagues at the Foreign Press Club in Guatemala said Lee had been planning to move to Mexico and had recently put adds in Guatemalan newspapers offering some of his possessions for sale. One add reportedly was found in the doorway of his apartment, but no valuables had been taken.\nOn November 9, 2001, CPJ wrote a letter to Guatemala's Attorney General Adolfo González Rodas, expressing its deep concern about the lack of progress in the investigation. \"While the motive for Lee's killing is unknown, it is quite clear that the murder investigation has been deeply flawed. Because Guatemalan authorities have not determined who killed Lee, or why he was killed, CPJ cannot rule out the journalist's work as a motive,\" CPJ wrote.\n\"The investigation into Lee's killing has been a tragedy of errors,\" the letter continued, \"and would probably have stalled completely had the journalist's family not fought to keep the limping inquiry alive. Fingerprints taken from the crime scene were never identified. Police conducted only cursory interviews with Lee's friends and quickly lost touch with at least one individual who had been identified as a potential suspect. It took nearly two months for an autopsy report to be issued.\"\nAmong the flaws the letter highlighted, was the fact that Guatemalan authorities kept Lee's apartment sealed for nearly four months. When Lee's brother Scott finally gained entry, he found a towel with bloodstains that did not match Lee's blood type. Only three months later was the blood shipped to Colombia for DNA tests. The results have still not been received in Guatemala.\nWhoever murdered Lee apparently stole his cell phone and used it to make calls, but authorities have made no effort to obtain a record of calls that might have been made after his death.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said.

According to a statement given that same day by Roberto Álvarez Heredia, a spokesperson for the Guerrero state attorney general’s office, two unidentified attackers entered the restaurant and immediately approached Montenegro, who was sitting with her husband. The assailants fired at least two shots at Montenegro’s face and abdomen, before fleeing, according to the statement and initial police report to which CPJ had access. The report did not say whether the attackers said anything to Montenegro before shooting.The 36-year-old journalist ran a satirical YouTube channel and an online news magazine called El Sillón, which she founded in 2012. She was more widely known as \"La Nana Pelucas\" (The Grandma in Wigs), her online persona featured on her satirical YouTube channel, El Sillón TV. Both as editor of El Sillón and as \"La Nana Pelucas,\" Montenegro covered local politics in Acapulco and the Guerrero region, and frequently mocked local politicians. El Sillón's Facebook page, which Montenegro administered with her husband, Samuel Muñuzuri, featured a variety of posts in the months before her death, including on topics such as beauty, culture, and politics.According to a February 6, 2018 statement from the Guerrero state attorney general Javier Olea, Montenegro had received threats in the months before her murder. He said that her publications had put her “in the view” of a local official. The statement did not specify the name of the official or which of Montenegro’s publications it was referring to. Olea did not elaborate on the nature of the threats Montenegro received. CPJ was unable to find any recent stories on El Sillón, Montenegro's El Sillón Facebook page or videos on her YouTube channel that met Olea's description. Her recent publications on El Sillón’s Facebook page included several critical posts about Acapulco mayor Evodio Velázquez and posts in support of candidates running for office in next July’s elections, but no reports on organized crime in Acapulco or its surrounding area.Several phone calls by CPJ in February, March and April to the office of Velázquez remained unanswered.Olea said that that Javi Daniel Cervantes Magno, the alleged leader of a local criminal gang that is active in Acapulco, ordered Montenegro's murder, according to the February 6 statement. A spokesperson for the state attorney general's office told CPJ on February 8 that he was unable to confirm that a warrant had been issued for Magno's arrest and did not return calls requesting further comment.CPJ could not locate Cervantes Magno for comment.José Antonio Rivera, a journalist from the region, told CPJ in a telephone conversation on February 7, 2018, that Montenegro “was well known for being very critical of local politicians.” Rivera added that she had “a very sharp tongue.”Montenegro and her husband, Samuel Muñuzuri, had been threatened previously by criminal gangs. On December 4, 2016, a series of “narcomantas,” (banners carrying messages attributed to organized crime) were placed around Acapulco, containing threats aimed at several people, including Montenegro and Muñuzuri, a multimedia producer, according to news reports. The banners mentioned a Facebook page named “Denuncias Acapulco Sin Sencura,” on which citizens could report crime, violence, corruption, and abuse of power by the authorities. The banner claimed Montenegro was one of the page’s administrators.

Da Silva posted stories on his blog about local drug traffickers, Janine told CPJ.The traffickers were angry with da Silva because of his work and his close relationship with local police, his brother Luiz Gabriel da Silva told CPJ. Da Silva said his brother would tip off police on drug trafficking and other criminal activities, and received information from the police on cases to publish online. \"The motivation perhaps came from the denouncements he published,\" Luiz Gabriel da Silva told CPJ via telephone. \"Our mother was hooked on crack and he could never accept that. So he hated to see the drug traffickers driving around in their big cars. He posted photos of them on his blog whenever they were arrested.\" Luís da Silva's friendliness with Aquiraz's previous mayor led him to a job in the town's marketing department, his brother told CPJ. CPJ was unable to determine the precise nature of the work. Da Silva also hosted an afternoon radio show featuring about 90 minutes of music and news on a station funded by the mayor, his brother said. He left both positions in January 2017 when the mayor lost his bid for re-election. In January 2016, da Silva filed a police report alleging an unnamed person in local politics had threatened him. Janine said it was unclear whether the threats were related to da Silva's reporting. \"We never knew of threats, but we could feel that he was afraid,\" Luiz Gabriel da Silva said of his brother. He said he believed the journalist had faced increased danger for several months but that he told family members not to worry about it."},{"id":1036,"location":"Dominican Republic","year":"2017","name":"Luis Manuel Medina","organization":"Fm 103.5","date":"February 14, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"San Pedro de Macorís","freelance":"No","description":"Radio journalist Luis Manuel Medina was shot and killed during a Facebook Live broadcast from the office of radio station FM 103.5 in the southeastern city of San Pedro de Macorís on February 14, 2017, according to press reports.\nMedina, a presenter for the news program \"Milenio Caliente,\" was killed in the recording booth while filming a broadcast on Facebook Live. Gunshots and a voice shouting, \"Shots, shots, shots!\" can be heard before the video abruptly ends. A gunman also shot and killed Leónidas Martínez, a director and producer at the radio station. Dayana García, an administrative worker at the radio station, was shot in the stomach and hospitalized in serious condition, according to a United Press International report.\nOn February 15, police identified José Rodríguez, 59, as the primary suspect in the murders. The same day, police gave chase to Rodríguez who shot at them several times before turning the gun on himself, police spokesman Nelson Rosario told reporters at a press conference.\nSome press reports raised questions about the official version, citing anonymous neighbors who claimed that Rodríguez was killed in a shoot-out. The National Forensic Institute said that Rodríguez was shot once in the head and called the death a probable suicide, according to a statement by the Attorney General's Office.\nRodríguez had been in a prolonged conflict with the State Sugar Council over plots of land he had purchased from them. He had appeared at the station on at least two occasions, at least once when the director of the State Sugar Council was giving an interview at the station, according to a report commissioned by the executive branch of the Dominican government.\nThe report concluded that the deadly attack was \"directly linked to the buying and selling operations of three land lots between José Rodríguez and the State Sugar Council,\" but called the reasons why Rodríguez took out his frustration on the journalists an \"indecipherable enigma.\" The report, produced by a commission headed by Flavio Darío Espinal, a lawyer for the executive branch of the Dominican government, concluded that there was no evidence that the reporters had any interest in the land deals associated with Rodríguez.\n\"The only explanation that  can be made in a minimally plausible way is that when Mr. Rodríguez showed up to the station on February 14, 2017, carrying copies of documents in a folder and perhaps in search of answers to his demand for the refund of the money he paid to the State Sugar Council... upon finding that he could not get a satisfactory answer to his request, since [the journalists] were neither in a position to give it...Mr. Rodríguez lost control and discharged the firearm that he carried against three innocent people who were fulfilling their work duties,\" the report stated.\nMedina reported on politics, and had recently denounced pollution in Laguna Mallén, a protected lake in San Pedro de Macorís, according to an article in The Guardian.

U.S. officials said the captors were alerted to the approaching special forces team, perhaps by a barking dog, and shot the hostages, according to news reports. Medics were unable to save either hostage. \nU.S. officials said the captors were likely on high alert after a failed attempt to rescue Somers in another special forces raid the previous month in Hadramawt. In a press release on December 4, 2014, National Security Council Spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said Obama had authorized the first rescue operation in coordination with Yemeni security forces to save Somers and other hostages after receiving reliable intelligence of their location but that Somers was not present when the forces arrived.\nAccording to news reports citing Yemeni officials, eight captives were freed in the first rescue operation after a gun battle with the militants but several other hostages, including Somers, were not rescued. The reports said the U.S. government had originally asked the media not to report on U.S. involvement in the raid for fear it would increase the danger to Somers.\nThe original raid led AQAP to acknowledge publicly for the first time that it was holding Somers, which the group did in a video released late at night on December 3, 2014. In the video, which was reviewed by CPJ before being removed from YouTube, Somers said he was kidnapped in Sana'a more than a year earlier and that his life was in danger. His statement was preceded by Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, one of the leaders of AQAP, saying that Somers \"will meet his inevitable fate\" unless the U.S. met the group's unspecified demands.\nSenior U.S. and Yemeni officials told ABC that they did not know what those demands were but speculated they may involve a prisoner exchange. U.S. officials cited the three-day deadline as the primary impetus for launching the second raid, according to news reports. \nIn a video released on December 4, 2014, Somers' brother, Jordan, and mother, Paula, appealed for Somers' release and said they did not know why Somers was being held. \"Luke is only a photojournalist, and he is not responsible for any actions the U.S. government has taken,\" his brother said in the video.\nSomers was kidnapped on a busy street in the middle of Sana'a in September 2013, according to news reports. No group claimed responsibility, but Somers' colleagues told CPJ at the time that they feared he was taken by Al-Qaeda or would be sold to them.\nSomers, who was born in the U.K. and was an American citizen, moved to Yemen in 2010, where he soon began working as a freelance journalist, according to news reports. His coverage of the 2011 revolution in Yemen and its aftermath was published by international and local outlets including Al-Jazeera English, BBC, Foreign Policy, Inter Press Service, National Yemen, The New York Times, and Yemen Times. He also edited for more than one English-language Yemeni newspaper. At the time of his kidnapping, he was working in the media office as an English editor and translator for the National Dialogue Conference, a body formed as part of the reconciliation process after former President Ali Abdullah Saleh stepped down in 2012.

Around 20 relatives and friends had gathered at Magas airport to greet\nYevloyev.\nShortly before leaving the plane, Yevloyev sent a text\nmessage to Magomed Khazbiyev, a friend and local opposition activist, telling\nhim that he had shared the flight with Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov, the\nfriend told CPJ.

He was taken to a city hospital with serious injuries and died without regaining consciousness, the report stated. The journalist reported on corruption and crime in his native region of Sverdlovsk, according to the Guardian. In the few months prior to his death, Borodin reported on several sensitive subjects.He gained national attention for his reporting on the deaths in Syria of Russian private military contractors fighting on the side of President Bashar al-Assad, the Guardian reported. In February and March 2018, Borodin reported from the town of Asbest, home to several men who left to fight in Syria with Wagner Group, a paramilitary organization with alleged ties to the Kremlin that suffered dozens of fatalities in February following an attack by United States-backed forces in Syria. Borodin interviewed relatives and the contractors' superiors, and attended their funerals in Asbest. The Kremlin denies any connection with Russian contractors fighting in Syria.In February 2018, the Borodin reported on Russian opposition candidate and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny's expose of Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch with close ties to the Kremlin, who Navalny has alleged funneled illicit profits into offshore accounts. In August 2017, Borodin wrote about the Russian film \"Matilda,\" which was lambasted by the Russian Orthodox Church for its portrayal of the late Tsar Nicholas II's personal life. On April 16, 2018, an unnamed spokesperson for Yekaterinburg's branch of Russia's Investigative Committee, the agency tasked with probing serious crimes, told the state news agency TASS that Borodin's apartment was locked from the inside and \"there is no evidence of foul play.\" The spokesperson also said investigators did not find a suicide note in the journalist's apartment and that the journalist was sober when he fell. On April 23, 2018, the Investigative Committee told Novy Den that they will not open a criminal investigation since there was \"no evidence of a crime,\" and the journalist's death will likely be treated as a \"tragic accident.\"CPJ's calls to the Yekaterinburg branch of the Investigative Committee went unanswered.Yekaterina Norseyeva, a Novy Den correspondent in Yekaterinburg, told CPJ on April 16, 2018, that it was \"very unlikely\" that Borodin had committed suicide. \"He was going to be transferred to our Moscow bureau; he was full of plans,\" she said.A Yekaterinburg-based civil rights defender and Borodin's friend, Vyacheslav Bashkov, on April 15 wrote on his Facebook page that Borodin contacted him at 5 a.m. on April 11 and said that \"security forces\" wearing camouflage and face masks were on his balcony and in the interior staircase of his building. Borodin told Bashkov that he thought the security forces were waiting for a court order to search his apartment and asked Bashkov to help him find a lawyer, according to the Facebook post.Bashkov wrote on Facebook that Borodin called him back an hour later and said he was mistaken and the security officers were conducting a drill.In his Facebook post, Bashkov said that he went to local police after he found out about Borodin's death, but police seemed uninterested and \"did not question [him] about much.\" Bashkov told CPJ that he was not aware of Borodin's whereabouts between the telephone call and the time of the journalist's fall, which he said likely happened during the afternoon of April 12, 2018. Bashkov also said it had become a \"regular practice\" for law enforcement to conduct drills in Yekaterinburg ahead of the World Cup.On April 17, 2018, Novy Den Editor-in-Chief Polina Rumyantseva told the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta that three days prior to his death, Borodin had told her he had been under surveillance. \"I warned the building security. I also advised [Borodin] to report this to the police,\" she said, and added that Borodin did not go to the police. Novy Den issued a statement on April 19, 2018, saying they had no reason to disbelieve the Investigative Committee's conclusions calling Borodin's death \"tragic event.\"CPJ research shows that Borodin's demise fits a pattern of journalists in Russia dying as they cover sensitive issues with potential repercussions for authorities, under circumstances that are not fully explained or investigated."},{"id":1072,"location":"Russia","year":"2006","name":"Maksim Maksimov","organization":"Gorod","date":"November 30, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"St. Petersburg","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Government Officials","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Maksimov, 41, an investigative reporter for the St. Petersburg weekly magazine Gorod, was declared dead by the Dzerzhinsky District Court in St. Petersburg on November 30, 2006, more than two years after he had been reported missing.\n\n Maksimov was last seen on June 29, 2004, when he went to meet with a source in the city's downtown district, the business daily Kommersant reported. A month later, police found his car parked near a local hotel. Maksimov's mobile phone without its SIM card resurfaced at a local flea market at about the same time, according to local press reports.\n\n Investigators and colleagues did not initially focus on Maksimov's journalism as a reason for his disappearance. At the time, Maksimov was seeking to trade his apartment in downtown St. Petersburg for a bigger one. Colleagues believed that he might have fallen victim to the organized crime gangs that control the real estate market in St. Petersburg, the news Web site Gazeta reported.\n\n For an entire year after the disappearance, police and prosecutors did not report any developments in the investigation. In June 2005, several Russian newspapers reported on the detention of at least three police officers--all senior investigators in the corruption division of the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry. The three were said to be suspects in Maksimov's disappearance and suspected murder.\n\n The initial report came from the news agency Interfax and cited an anonymous source in the Northwestern Federal District's Prosecutor-General's Office. The report said that investigators believed that Maksimov was murdered for his work as a journalist and that two majors and a lieutenant colonel were considered suspects.\n\n The suspects, Kommersant said, were held on unrelated criminal charges of forgery and falsifying evidence. The English-language daily Moscow Times said that St. Petersburg police confirmed the Interfax report but refused to give further details.\n\n Soon after those reports appeared, however, on June 30, 2005, the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry issued a statement denying the involvement of the three police investigators in Maksimov's disappearance. The Interior Ministry said it \"considers inadmissible and premature the appearance of press reports, accusing [the officers] of masterminding the murder of journalist Maksim Maksimov.\" The Interior Ministry gave no information on how the investigation was developing. The statement generated no follow-up by the authorities.\n\n In the absence of official information, speculation about what could have happened to Maksimov continued to circulate in the Russian press.\n\n The St. Petersburg newspaper Smena, where Maksimov worked before joining Gorod, said on June 27, 2005, that it learned from unnamed sources in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry that Maksimov disappeared was targeted by high-ranking officers in retaliation for the journalist's investigation of corruption in the local Interior Ministry. The paper said that the perpetrators, three masterminds and two executors, were in detention.\n\nKommersant carried a similar story the next day. The paper said investigators believed Maksimov was strangled to death to prevent him from reporting on corruption in the St. Petersburg branch of the Interior Ministry. Several newspapers described in detail what they said happened to Maksimov the day he disappeared, and how he had been killed, but they did not attribute their accounts or explain how they had received the information.\n\n Other reports noted that Maksimov had investigated the murders of several Russian businessmen and politicians, including Galina Starovoytova, a parliamentary deputy shot in her apartment building in 1998.\n\n Authorities have not disclosed further information on the investigation, the identities of anyone held in connection with the crime, or the status of any criminal case. The journalist's body has not been found.\n\n Rimma Maksimova, Maksim Maksimov's mother, described her communication with prosecutors in charge of the investigation as \"difficult.\" Maksimova told CPJ that she had received no answer to queries she sent to the Northwestern Federal District's prosecutor-general's office and the Northwestern Federal District's Interior Ministry in St. Petersburg.\n\n On November 24, 2006, Maksimova met with St. Petersburg Gov. Valentina Matvienko who assured her that solving Maksimov's case was a priority for St. Petersburg's administration. But the meeting did not result in any developments, and Maksimova told CPJ that authorities stopped answering her queries."},{"id":1073,"location":"Pakistan","year":"2010","name":"Malik Arif","organization":"Samaa tv","date":"April 16, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Quetta","job":"Camera Operator","medium":"Television","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Arif, a cameraman, was killed in a suicide bombing at a\nlocal hospital, news reports said.

A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":1108,"location":"Argentina","year":"1993","name":"Mario Bonino","organization":"Union de trabajadores","date":"November 15, 1993","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Buenos Aires","freelance":"No","description":"Bonino, a press officer for the Union de Trabajadores de Prensa, Buenos Aires' largest media workers' union, disappeared after he left his house to attend a union activity.

The person who tipped off the police also told them that de Abreu Filho had worked as a security guard for Rio de Janeiro state assemblywoman Andréia Zito, daughter of Duque de Caxias mayor Zito dos Santos.At the time of his arrest, de Abreu Filho worked as a bodyguard for the wife of Waldir Zito, mayor of the city of Belford Roxo and brother of José Camilo Zito dos Santos.After witnesses were shown a picture of de Abreu Filho and recognized him as the murderer, Judge Geraldo José Machado ordered that he be held in temporary prison.

Dana\nwas struck in the torso while filming near Abu Ghraib Prison, outside\nBaghdad, in the afternoon. He had been reporting with a colleague near\nthe prison after a mortar attack had killed six Iraqis there the\nprevious night. The soldier in the tank who fired on Dana did so\nwithout warning, while the journalist filmed the vehicle approaching\nhim from about 55 yards (50 meters).\n\nU.S. military officials said the soldier who opened fire mistook Dana's\ncamera for a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher. There was no\nfighting taking place in the area, and the journalists had been\noperating in the vicinity of the prison with the knowledge of U.S.\ntroops near the prison gates.\n\nIn an August 18 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld,\nCPJ protested the shooting, stating that it raised \"serious questions\nabout the conduct of U.S. troops and their rules of engagement.\"\n\nOn September 22, the U.S. military announced that it had concluded its\ninvestigation into the incident. A spokesman for U.S. Central Command\n(Centcom) in Iraq told CPJ that while Dana's killing was \"regrettable,\"\nthe soldier \"acted within the rules of engagement.\" No further details\nwere provided. The results of the investigation have not been made\npublic. A Centcom spokesman said other details of the report are\nclassified.\n\nDana's soundman, Nael Shyioukhi, who witnessed the incident, told CPJ\nthat he and Dana arrived at the prison with their driver, Munzer Abbas,\nin the late afternoon. According to Shyioukhi, several journalists were\nalso in the area. Shyioukhi said that after a short while Dana\nsuggested that they approach the prison gates to begin filming. At one\npoint, Dana identified himself to a U.S. soldier as a journalist from\nReuters and asked if a spokesman was available to comment on camera\nabout the attack the previous night. The soldier replied that he could\nnot comment, and no spokesmen were available. Dana then asked the\nsoldier if he and Shyioukhi could film the prison from a nearby bridge.\nAccording to Shyioukhi, the soldier politely told them they were\nwelcome to do so.\n\nAfter filming from the bridge, located between 330 and 660 yards (300\nand 600 meters) from the prison, Dana and Shyioukhi, who were wearing\njeans and T-shirts, packed their equipment in their car and began to\nhead off for the Reuters office. As they approached the main road to\nthe prison, Dana noticed a convoy of tanks approaching and told Abbas\nto stop so he could film it. According to Shyioukhi, he and Dana were\nnot apprehensive because the area was calm, and it was apparent that\nU.S. troops were in complete control. Neither Dana nor Shyioukhi were\nwearing flak jackets, and their car was not marked press.\n\nDana exited the car and set up his blue, canvas-encased camera with a\nwhite microphone facing the tanks while Shyioukhi lit a cigarette.\nShyioukhi said Dana filmed for about 10 seconds, when suddenly, without\nwarning, several shots rang out from the lead tank, which was\napproximately 55 yards (50 meters) away.\n\nShyioukhi ducked for cover then heard Dana scream and place his hand on\nhis stomach, which was bleeding profusely. He said that within moments\nof the shooting, approximately six U.S. soldiers, including the one who\nshot Dana, surrounded them. Shyioukhi recounted that the soldier who\nshot Dana screamed at Shyioukhi to \"stand back.\"\n\nA doctor arrived on an armored personnel carrier (APC) after about 10\nminutes and tried to stop the bleeding. The APC took Dana back to the\nprison complex for treatment and to get him evacuated to a hospital.\n\nU.S. military spokesman Col. Guy Shields called Dana's death a \"tragic\nincident\" and promised to do everything to avoid a similar incident in\nthe future. When questioned by London's Independent\nabout the rules of engagement for U.S. troops, Shields said, \"I can't\ngive you details on the rules of engagement, but the enemy is not in\nformations, they are not wearing uniforms.

The 15-minute video, entitled \"Inspiration of Satan,\" is marked as having been produced by the local media branch of the Islamic State group in Deir al-Zour.

Yasser left the province shortly before the Islamic State group took control in 2014, but Mohammed remained behind.

At the time, Houthi rebel forces and supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh were fighting to re-impose a siege on the city, defended by a patchwork of pro-government forces and local fighters.\nAccording to the news reports, al-Majidi joined a group of journalists on the front lines in the Dhabab area of western Taiz, when Houthi and pro-Saleh forces fired on them with small arms. Al-Majidi was struck in the head and died instantly. Another four journalists were also injured, the reports said.\nA graphic video published by Yemen TV shows a chaotic scene as journalists and gunmen alike run down a long, empty road, fleeing bullets fired by unseen gunmen. The video then cuts to al-Majidi's body in the morgue, blood staining his striped polo shirt as other journalists mourn.\nAl-Majidi began working as an activist and photojournalist at the start of the 2011 protest movement to oust former president Saleh, according to the reports. According to the independent Al-Masdar news website, al-Majidi worked under the pseudonym Mohammed al-Yemeni, refusing to reveal his real name and never publishing a picture of himself working.\nHe primarily published his photographs on his personal Facebook page under the Mohammed al-Yemeni pseudonym. His older posts primarily focused on political protests and social events. His most recent work focused exclusively on Yemen's descent into war, where his posts on the fighting in Taiz were widely distributed. Numerous local news outlets republished his photographs of the fighting and the leaders directing it. In one of his more recent set of photographs widely published in local media, al-Majidi highlighted the damaged and inadequate military supplies the \"resistance\" in Taiz had received to fight Houthi-Saleh forces.\nAl-Majidi made clear in his reporting his support for the forces fighting the Houthi-Saleh rebels. News reports said that in recognition of his support, a military leader, Hamoud Saeed al-Mekhlafi, entrusted him to become his personal photographer.\nIn a Facebook video published by Ayman al-Qurashi, a photographer based in Taiz, al-Majidi, wearing a striped polo shirt and no armor, can be seen filming right next to al-Mekhlafi as al-Mekhlafi urges his fighters to advance. Al-Qurashi says al-Majidi was killed moments later.\nAl-Mekhlafi's office did not respond to CPJ's written requests for comment in October 2016 to confirm his relationship with al-Majidi.\nOnly two weeks before his death, al-Majidi was shot in his right leg while reporting. He posted on his Facebook page that it was not a serious injury, as \"the bullet entered and exited from the muscle.\"\nHis injury and the repeated coverage of the violence in Taiz seemed to wear on al-Majidi. On March 18, he confessed on Facebook, \"The truth is I'm tired, and I can no longer continue for need of an open-ended vacation.\" Yet he did not stop working. On the day he was killed, his final post reads, \"We're going out to the battle again.

At least 16 other people were killed in the incident, including the Palestine Network's correspondent Rami Rayan and Sameh al-Aryan, a cameraman for the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV channel, according to news reports.\nThe Palestine Network crew was at the Shijaiyah market to cover Palestinian citizens shopping for basic necessities during a four-hour truce called by the Israeli military, Nasr Abu Foul, the network's manager, told CPJ. Abu Foul told CPJ that the network's editor, Mahmoud al-Qasas, had been badly injured in the strike and was hospitalized with head injuries. The local Al-Manara media agency said its cameraman, Hamid al-Shobaky, was also injured and hospitalized in the incident.\nThere were conflicting reports on the role al-Deiri played for the network. A statement issued by the network said he was a cameraman. But al-Deiri's father, Nour al-Deiri, told CPJ that his son worked more as an assistant to Rayan, helping to carry equipment and cover events, including shooting video.\nThere were also conflicting reports on when al-Deiri died and when he was buried, but al-Deiri's father told CPJ that his son was killed on July 30, 2014, and buried the next day. He said he went to the hospital to donate blood and look for his son after hearing about the shelling but that he could not find any information. Late that night, he finally received a call saying his son was dead.\nPhotographs posted on Facebook on July 31, 2014, show al-Deiri's body in a shroud being carried to be buried among grieving friends and relatives.\nA graphic video posted by the Al-Manara media agency shows repeated explosions rocking Shijaiyah on July 30, 2014, as the injured cry out for help amid ringing sirens. At the beginning of the video, Rayan is seen filming as ambulances arrive wearing a clearly marked press helmet and vest. At minute 3:49, the video shows Rayan lying dead between the two ambulances he had been filming minutes earlier. The video then cuts to al-Deiri lying in an alleyway in the fetal position, blood pooling at his feet. Several bystanders create a makeshift gurney out of a blanket and carry al-Deiri away. Unlike Rayan, al-Deiri is wearing civilian clothing: jeans and a black T-shirt. No camera or press equipment can be seen in the video.\nA picture published on Felesteen Online news website shows al-Deiri in the back of a truck on the same blanket seen in the al-Manara video. It is not clear if the others in the photo are placing him on the truck where he was hit or taking him off the truck at the hospital.\nAn internal IDF committee led by investigators who had not been part of the chain of command during the incident found that the \"tragic\" civilian deaths on July 30 were the result of \"a number of coincidences and series of events that a military commander should not be expected to predict,\" according to a statement published in March 2015. The committee said that IDF forces fired mortar shells in response to enemy fire, not realizing that a previous round of IDF mortar fire had struck a civilian building and led to civilians, including journalists, to gather in the area despite previous orders to evacuate. The committee said that aerial surveillance was unavailable at the time but previous surveillance had not spotted civilians and that mortar shells were chosen in lieu of more powerful artillery shells to minimize collateral damage. The committee also said it could not rule out the possibility that some of the casualties that day resulted from Palestinian fire.\nThe final report of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, published in June 2015, cast doubt on whether the IDF took full precautions in minimizing civilian casualties in this instance, specifically questioning why the IDF did not have real-time aerial surveillance and did not use weapons more precise than mortar rounds.

The statement called Saturday's \nattack \"just a warning\" and threatened more attacks on Al-Arabiya and other \nmedia outlets in Iraq. The statement's authenticity could not be independently \nverified. \n\nEarlier, a group calling itself the 1920 Brigades said it had carried out \nthe attack, but Al-Arabiya later reported that the same group denied \nresponsibility in a recorded tape. \n\nAbout 35 staffers were meeting on the first floor when the bomb exploded \ndirectly outside the bureau's front entrance. The blast, which took place in a \nneighborhood that also houses Iraqi officials and government buildings, left a \nlarge crater in the street outside and collapsed the building's first floor, \ncausing a fire. \n\nAl-Arabiya's Web site reported that the station has received numerous \nthreats from those describing themselves as supporters of \"Abu Musab al-Zarqawi\" \nprotesting its coverage, and demanding that the station support the \"jihad\" \nagainst the U.S occupation and Iraqi government."},{"id":1306,"location":"Iraq","year":"2006","name":"Nabil Ibrahim al-Dulaimi","organization":"Radio dijla","date":"December 4, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Baghdad","job":"Editor","medium":"Radio","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Unidentified gunmen killed al-Dulaimi, 36, a news editor for the privately owned station, shortly after he left his home in Baghdad's Al-Washash neighborhood to go to work, sources at the station told CPJ.

Palacios arrived about 10 p.m. with a cousin in the back seat of a double cabin 4-by-4 pickup, and his girlfriend, a doctor, in the passenger seat. Neighbors told local reporters that a few shots were initially fired, apparently by a lookout, followed by a fusillade of gunfire as other assailants joined in. Palacios died at the scene. Dr. Yorleny Sánchez, badly injured, died two weeks later. Palacios' cousin was not injured, local press reports said.\nSeveral work-related motives emerged in a July 2010 CPJ investigation. Palacios opposed the 2009 military-backed coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, and he had turned the TV station into an openly opposition channel, his colleagues said. Military personnel appeared at his house and detained him and his family for several hours in June 2009. That episode, along with other threats from the military, was strong enough that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued an order to the government of Honduras to protect Palacios. According to the commission, it was one of more than 400 such orders issued for journalists and activists in Honduras in 2009 and 2010. \nThe Honduran government was required by an international treaty to follow the directives, but it appeared to have ignored most of them. The government asserted that it never received an order in the Palacios case, although the Inter-American Commission noted that it had a signed receipt from the Honduran Supreme Court.\nIn the months before his slaying, Palacios campaigned on behalf of a group of several thousand peasants who had been demanding vast tracts of land they said rightfully belonged to them. They claimed that a few large landowners, in violation of agrarian reform laws, had greatly underpaid them for land many years earlier. Some of the land was retaken by the peasants--simply stolen, according to the landowners--and there were occasional armed encounters. Peasant activists said some of their leaders had been abducted and disappeared, or singled out and killed.\nAside from the wide belief that Palacios' killing was politically inspired, some CPJ sources said he could have angered a local drug gang with a recent news story about a cartel-linked kidnapping. Sources also said that Palacios, like other Tocoa journalists, had been accused of extorting money from sources. Palacios' father, José Heriberto Palacios denied his son could have been dishonest. \"They killed him because he was honest and was not corrupt,\" he told CPJ.\nThe case was marked by a series of investigative failures. Almost three months after Palacios was gunned down, a team of investigators came to his grave in his hometown of Rigores, dug up his body, and at the graveside, in the open, conducted an autopsy. The coroner never examined the body after the murder; it had gone straight from the murder scene to the funeral home. Investigators also started asking news photographers if they had any pictures of the crime scene because police had no photographs of their own. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Arody Reyes, conceded to CPJ that though the gunmen had lain in wait for hours at Palacios' house, police had not been able to retrieve any evidence from the scene.\nReyes said the exhumation and autopsy were suddenly important because the Honduran government had enlisted the help of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Local investigators, Reyes said, needed to show their U.S. counterparts something."},{"id":1313,"location":"Algeria","year":"1995","name":"Naïma Hammouda","organization":"Révolution africaine","date":"August 2, 1995","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Saoula","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Culture","gender":"Female","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Hammouda, a cultural reporter with the weekly Révolution Africaine and formerly with Le Matin and L'Hebdo Libéré, was shot to death.

Jerf, who had recently finished a documentary on the Syrian citizen journalist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, was taken to a Turkish hospital where he later died, according to news reports.Some supporters of Islamic State celebrated the killing on social media and the Saudi-owned pan-Arab Al-Arabiya news channel said the militant group claimed responsibility in a statement.Jerf's murder came amid a campaign of violence by Islamic State against members of RBSS and other Syrian journalists. On December 16, 2015, Ahmed Mohamed al-Mousa, a 23-year-old editor for RBSS, was shot dead in Idlib province. In October 2015 Ibrahim Abd al-Qader was killed alongside fellow journalist Fares Hamadi in Urfa, southeastern Turkey.In a video published online on March 8, 2016 by Islamic State's local branch in Deir Ezzor, Syria, the militants claimed responsibility for the murders of all four journalists. The video, \"Escaping won't do you any good,\" showed two new hostages who identified themselves as Mohamed al-Kardoush and Jamal al-Ati, whom the militants accused of providing information to Western governments. It was not immediately clear if the hostages were journalists. Jerf had produced a documentary about Syrian activists being killed by Islamic State in Aleppo in 2013 and 2014. The documentary, which he published on his YouTube channel in December 2015 and which aired on pan-Arab satellite channel Al-Arabiya the month before, attracted more than 12 million views and tens of thousands of comments on Al-Arabiya's Facebook page, the channel reported. Jerf also directed a documentary on RBSS, the group CPJ honored in November 2015 with its International Press Freedom Award.Shortly before his death, Jerf had been issued a visa so he could move to France with his family, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Paris-based organization, which supported his visa application, said Jerf had received threats over his work documenting Islamic State atrocities. Zara Hasan, a Syrian activist who said she accompanied Jerf to the hospital after he was shot, told CNN the filmmaker also received death threats from Islamic State.On January 10, the Guardian cited Turkish state media as reporting that three men suspected of being involved in his killing were in custody in Gaziantep.On June 9, 2017, the Second Gaziantep Court of Serious Crimes sentenced Yusuf Hamed Eşveri to two life terms in prison plus five years and five months for killing Jerf. He was convicted on charges of \"pre-planned murder,\" \"attempting to overthrow the constitutional order by force\" and violating the laws for owning weapons and explosives, Turkish media reported.Three other suspects, Farag al-Hussein, Ali Çerkez and Reyad Matar, were acquitted for lack of evidence.A person in close touch with Jerf’s family told CPJ that the journalist’s relatives were not satisfied with the legal process and that they had not been represented by a lawyer of their own.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records.

The gunmen fled the scene. Dabholkar died from injuries sustained to his neck and back, police said.\nDabholkar was the editor of a weekly Marathi-language print magazine called Sadhana (Spiritual Devotion), which promotes scientific thought and covers topics including caste, politics, and religion. Over the years, Dabholkar had angered many Indians with his lectures and writings, which propagated rationalism and scientific thinking in a country where superstitious beliefs are still rampant, the reports said.\nDabholkar, a prominent campaigner against religious superstition, had also spent several years writing in support of legislation to ban fraudulent and exploitative superstitious practices. A few days before his murder, the Maharashtra state government said it would introduce a controversial anti-superstition bill, according to reports.\nDabholkar had received threats in the days before his murder, his son, Hamid, told NDTV. Sadhana often published articles on sensitive issues, including the creation of a separate Telangana state, student suicides, farmer suicides, slums, and the ideology behind India's Naxalite movement.\nDabholkar had also founded the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (Committee for Eradication of Blind Faith), a group that encouraged social reform in India.\nMaharashtra Home Minister R. R. Patil said on August 23, 2013, that police were investigating the murder.\n\nAlso in August 2013, Pune police arrested two alleged arms dealers, Manish Nagori and Vilas Khandelwal, on charges of extortion, reports said. The pair, who were later named as suspects in the journalist's murder, were released on bail because of a lack of evidence, police said, according to reports. Because the men face charges in other cases, they remain in jail. Both have denied any role in the murder, and Nagori said that investigating authorities offered him money to accept involvement in the murder, reports said. Authorities denied the allegation.\n \nIn May 2014 the Maharashtra state government handed the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation. Investigations were delayed for a year because of staff shortages at the agency, according to reports. In July and August 2015, the bureau wrote to the state government to request that more officers be assigned to the case, The Hindu reported.\n \nIn July 2015, relatives of Dabholkar filed a writ petition at the Bombay High Court seeking court monitoring of the investigation, according to reports. In December 2015, the Central Bureau of Investigation informed the Bombay High Court that it had identified two suspects and handed the names to the court, reports said. The names were kept confidential, The Hindu reported.\n \nIn 2016, the bureau questioned several members of the hard-line Hindu group Sanatan Sanstha, which is believed to be behind the killing. The Sanatan Sanstha denies any role in the murder, reports said. Forensic analysis of the bullet cartridges found at the scene of Dabholkar's killing and that of writers Govind Pansare and MM Kalburgi suggest a common set of killers, reports said."},{"id":1326,"location":"Pakistan","year":"2011","name":"Nasrullah Khan Afridi","organization":"Pakistan television and mashriq","date":"May 10, 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Peshawar","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Print Reporter","medium":"Print, Television","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Afridi, a reporter for Pakistan Television and the local\nMashriq newspaper, was killed when his car blew up in the city of Peshawar,\naccording to local and international news reports.

He had been stabbed to death.\nImmediately after Jain's death, police said they suspected Maoists were responsible for the murder and said pamphlets at the scene said Jain was killed because he was a police informer. Police did not comment on allegations that he was an informer. \nA week after Jain's death, blogger Kamal Shukla wrote that Jain had not been on good terms with local police and cited the journalist's frequent coverage of false complaints filed by local police against villagers. Shukla denied the possibility that Jain may have been a police informant, according to The Hoot, a South Asian media watchdog. But Shukla also said that Jain's social activism may have led to his murder. A week before his death, Jain had been instrumental in helping free an individual allegedly held by Maoists, and this may have angered the Maoists, Shukla said. \nThe president of the Chhattisgarh Union of Working Journalists, NRK Pillai, told The Hoot that there was the possibility that Jain may have been pressured by the police to provide information.\nOther local journalists, including Anil Mishra, correspondent for investigative magazine Tehelka, said they believed local criminals could be responsible for Jain's murder. A few days before his death, the reporter had exposed tin smuggling in the region, which led to a violent confrontation between the journalist and family members of an alleged smuggler. \nAlmost two months after Jain's murder, news accounts reported that a local Maoist group had claimed responsibility for the attack, but did not offer a motive or further details.\nIn an April 2013 statement, the Maoist group said it regretted junior members killing the journalist, reports said. A spokesperson for the Maoist group's central committee, the highest decision-making body of the group, said a misunderstanding between the junior members and the leadership led to the killing.\nFollowing the murder, police announced a reward for information on the killing, according to news accounts.

He had been disfigured, and suffered machete and bullet wounds, the police said.\nGarcía, 23, had been working in community radio since he was 13, when he joined a local youth anti-violence program. He had been working in a leadership role in the radio station since at least 2013, a colleague of García, who preferred to remain anonymous out of fear of reprisal, told CPJ.\nAngélica Cárcamo, education coordinator of the Association for Radio and Participatory Programs (ARPAS), who had known García for five years, told CPJ that Expressa's programming included a variety of topics, including music, human rights, religion, and anti-violence programming. Expressa is one of seven community radio stations in the area.\nAfter the killing, ARPAS and two other prominent Salvadoran journalist organizations released a joint statement condemning the killing. The groups said they believed the murder was linked to García's work at the radio station.\nViolence between criminal groups has made El Salvador the murder capital of the Western Hemisphere, and one of the most dangerous countries in the world outside of a war zone, according to press reports. Homicides spiked after a truce between the dominant rival youth gangs Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 broke down in 2014.\nLocal journalists and police officers who spoke with CPJ described Tacuba as a municipality deeply affected by gang violence. Police told CPJ that El Carrizal, where García lived, is mostly controlled by MS-13, but that neighboring towns are dominated by Barrio 18.\nCárcamo said that she believed there were three motives behind García's murder, and all were in retaliation for his work in the radio. She said that García had refused to be recruited by the gangs, had banned criminals from using the radio to broadcast, and had granted police space on the radio as part of a violence-prevention program. She added that García was a target for recruitment because of his age, but also as a result of his prominent position in the radio and in the community.\nCárcamo said that she had seen García only five days before the killing and she didn't know of any threats at that time. After his death, she was told by local colleagues that in fact García received death threats weeks before the murder.\nHis colleague who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed to CPJ that García was threatened two weeks before his murder. \"The threats were related to his program on youth violence prevention,\" he said. At the time of the killing, García was directing the radio by himself, his colleague said. García had banned several people from participating in his programs because of their links with criminals.\nLocal police said there may be another reason for his killing. Pedro Antonio Alas, head of the Tacuba police, told CPJ that he believed García may have been killed for his friendship with the local leader of the Barrio 18 gang, involved in community radio in a neighboring town. Alas said that García was not a gang member, but speculated that members of MS-13 -- the rival gang -- could have killed García in retaliation. Alas did not discount the possibility that Garcías was killed for not allowing gang members to use the radio station.\nSerafín Valencia, the director of the Association of Salvadoran Journalists, told CPJ that journalists and activists who work for community radio are often vulnerable to threats from criminal groups and local politicians, who have been linked at times with organized crime.\nOn October 21, the attorney general's office announced that four gang members involved in the killing of Humberto García were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, according to reports on local news sites.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":1362,"location":"Mexico","year":"2011","name":"Noel López Olguín","organization":"Freelance","date":"March 2011","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Veracruz","job":"Columnist / Commentator, Photographer","medium":"Print","coverage":"Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"López, a columnist for the\nnewspaper La Verdad de Jáltipan in the state of Veracruz, was kidnapped on March 8 by gunmen\nin two SUVs, local authorities told CPJ.

SMART's general coordinator, Abdou al-Fadhel, told CPJ Ghazal died while covering the bombardment for the outlet.\n\nGhazal's brother, Ghaith, told CPJ that Ghazal was at his family's house when they heard the sound of barrel bombs exploding. Ghazal was killed after leaving the house to film the bombardment and to help the injured. Ghaith told CPJ his brother intended to send footage of the bombing to SMART but was killed before he could capture any footage.\n\nSMART reported that Ghazal died from shrapnel wounds to the chest and shoulder. Some pro-opposition outlets published a graphic picture of Ghazal after he had died, with a deep gash in his right shoulder.\n\nThree days before Ghazal's death Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, described barrel bombs as \"Assad's most devastating weapon\" used against civilians. Since the start of the civil war, the Assad government has arbitrarily bombed civilian areas such as Taftanaz by rolling makeshift bombs filled with shrapnel and explosives out the doors of its fleet of helicopters. President Bashar al-Assad has denied indiscriminately bombing civilians with barrel bombs despite the overwhelming evidence presented by human rights groups and international observers. \n\nLocal news reports said at least five people were killed and more than two dozen were injured in the bombing of Taftanaz, and the pro-opposition Taftanaz Media Office published graphic footage of the wounded receiving treatment at a crowded clinic.\n\nThe day before Ghazal's death, government and opposition forces agreed to a wide-ranging ceasefire in Idlib province, including Taftanaz, in the wake of major rebel advances, news reports said. The most powerful rebel coalition fighting in Idlib, Jaish al-Fateh, responded to the bombardment of Taftanaz by shelling government-held towns nearby, according to reports. Despite the violent start, the ceasefire largely held in the weeks after Ghazal's death, reports said.\n\nSMART News Agency said Ghazal previously worked as a reporter for the Taftanaz Media Office and the media office for Ahrar al-Sham, a rebel groups belonging to the Jaish al-Fateh coalition. Several of Ahrar al-Sham's founders had ties to al-Qaeda and, at the time of Ghazal's death, the Jaish al-Fateh coalition included al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, the Nusra Front. SMART's coordinator al-Fadhel said Ghazal joined the news agency in 2013 and was not working for any other organization besides SMART.\n\nGhaith Ghazal confirmed his brother had been part of Ahrar al-Sham as a fighter and a member of one of its media centers, helping to publicize the group, but that he was no longer a member of Ahrar al-Sham when he began working for SMART.\n\nGhazal regularly posted videos published by SMART on Facebook but because SMART does not usually use bylines for its videos, it was not clear which were filmed by him. Three weeks before his death, SMART published photos under Ghazal's byline of rubble left behind in Sarmin by what the agency said was government shelling in the Idlib province town.\n\nGhaith Ghazal told CPJ that his 24-year-old brother was married and has a two-year old son and six-month old daughter. He left his studies at nursing school to join the protest movement at the start of the uprising against the Assad government in 2011, and was detained as a result for a month in 2012."},{"id":1380,"location":"Rwanda","year":"1994","name":"Obed Bazimaziki","organization":"Le flambeau","date":"April 11, 1994","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Kigali","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Paramilitary Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Obed Bazimaziki, a journalist with the opposition paper Le Flambeau, \nwas killed near his home in Nyakabanda, Kigali.

He died on February 1.\nSierra wrote a Sunday column for the 80-year-old newspaper in which he frequently highlighted political corruption and human rights abuses committed by leftist guerrillas, a rival right-wing paramilitary army, and state security agents, said Alvaro Segura López, editor of La Patria.\nHowever, the 42-year-old journalist was most critical of local political bosses who, according to a March 6 editorial in El Tiempo, Colombia's top daily newspaper, \"run the department like a feudal colony.\" Sierra frequently accused prominent politicians from the local Liberal and Conservative parties of nepotism, vote buying, and looting public coffers.\nFollowing death threats in 1998, Sierra was assigned bodyguards for a short period but later stopped using them, according to a joint investigation into the journalist's murder carried out by seven of Colombia's leading newspapers and news magazines.\nThe threats came after regional assemblyman Francisco Ferney Tapasco González was removed from office after authorities discovered that in the 1970s he had been convicted of selling military ration cards while serving as the mayor of Supia, Caldas Department, according to the investigation.\nSierra publicly backed the legal process to remove Tapasco and also used his weekly column to revisit another incident in which the lawmaker was convicted of concealing information about the 1991 murder of a schoolteacher in Caldas, according to the investigation.\nSince April 2001, Sierra had also been investigating possible links between Tapasco and a gang of assassins. Shortly before his death he had told colleagues that if anything happened to him Tapasco would be to blame. The former politician denied involvement in the killing.\nOn the same day Sierra was shot, police arrested 21-year-old Luis Fernando Soto Zapata, who later confessed to having shot Sierra and was sentenced on May 8, 2002, to 19 and a half years in prison.\nSoto told the court that he shot Sierra on a whim after mistaking him for a man who allegedly killed a relative several years ago. However, a public prosecutor told CPJ that he doubted the claim, pointing out that footage from a hidden police camera showed Soto lingering for more than two hours before the shooting at the spot where Sierra was killed.\nPolice also arrested Luis Arley Ortiz on the day Sierra was shot. Authorities released Ortiz soon after, but issued a warrant for his arrest again in May 2, alleging that he acted as a middleman between a gang of assassins and the person or people who allegedly ordered Sierra's death. He was convicted, along with Luis Tabares Hernández, also known as Tilín, to 28 years in prison.\nOn July 17, authorities charged Francisco Antonio Quintero Tabares with homicide for Sierra's killing. Quintero is believed to be the boss of the gang of hit men that allegedly included Soto.\nFearing the Sierra murder would remain unsolved, seven Colombian newspapers and magazines formed Project Manizales to try to investigate the case. The Sierra killing was also the subject of a documentary, \"The Battle of Silence.\" In the ensuing years, at least nine witnesses were murdered, the Bogotá-based Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) said in a statement.\nIn 2011, nine years after Sierra was killed, authorities charged Tapasco with being one of the suspected masterminds of the crime. Tapasco was also convicted in 2010 for working with paramilitary death squads, according to news reports. In late 2013, Tapasco was acquitted but prosecutors said they would appeal. In June 2015, he was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 36 years in prison. In November 2015, he was captured by authorities in Manizales, according to news reports.\nThe court also convicted Fabio López Escobar and Jorge Hernando López Escobar of murder in the Sierra case and sentenced them in absentia to nearly 29 years in prison. The case marked the first time in Colombia that everyone involved in a journalist's murder was convicted, according to CPJ research. As of November 2015, Fabio López Escobar and Jorge Hernando López Escobar had not been arrested, according to reports.\nTapasco's lawyer said he would appeal his client's conviction to the Supreme Court, according to news reports."},{"id":1403,"location":"Philippines","year":"2006","name":"Orlando Tapios Mendoza","organization":"Freelance","date":"April 4, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Tarlac","freelance":"Yes","description":"Mendoza, a part-time newspaper editor and columnist, was shot several times by unidentified men as he was returning home in Tarlac, 65 miles (110 kilometers) north of Manila.

ABC Color reported that Acosta, who fled the town, was heavily involved in drug trafficking and that he and other drug traffickers were angered by Medina's coverage of the marijuana trade because it had disrupted their business.\nThe mayor's brother, Wilson Acosta Marques, cousin Flavio Acosta Riveros, and driver, Arnaldo Javier Cabrera López, were also charged with being the gunmen and accomplices. All the men were fugitives and Acosta was replaced as mayor, according to news reports.\nAccording to news reports, records showed that nearly two weeks after the murder, Acosta crossed the border to renew his driving permit in Brazil, where he has dual citizenship. The reports said authorities feared that Acosta had fled to Brazil because the country does not have an extradition treaty with Paraguay. Authorities requested an international warrant for the arrest of all four men from Interpol, according to news reports.\nABC Color alleged that Acosta's political and police connections, including a prominent congresswoman, had allowed the men to flee. Public prosecutor Cañete was later removed from the investigation for allegedly having intervened on Acosta's behalf in previous criminal cases, according to news reports. On November 8, 2014, authorities arrested an individual they accused of belonging to Acosta's criminal group and helping him escape.\nThree weeks after the murder, the Paraguayan congress announced the creation of a bicameral commission to investigate the crime, according to news reports."},{"id":1417,"location":"Mexico","year":"2000","name":"Pablo Pineda","organization":"La opinión","date":"April 9, 2000","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Matamoros","freelance":"No","description":"At approximately 2:45 a.m., U.S. Border Patrol agents found the body of Pineda, a reporter and photographer for the Mexican newspaper La Opinión, in Los Indios, just outside Harlingen, Texas.The agents had watched two people cross the Rio Grande carrying a bundle wrapped in a white sheet, which they deposited on the U.S. bank of the river.

At the time of the attack, the freelance correspondent for the regional newspaper El Piñero de la Cuenca and news website Al Calor Político was enrolled in a Veracruz state-sponsored protection program for journalists who have been threatened and was under police protection, after temporarily fleeing Veracruz earlier this year.

On November 28, 1998, he embarked on a 10-day trip to report on the Huichol Indians, an indigenous population that lives in a mountainous area stretching across Nayarit, Jalisco, and Durango states.  The journalist was last seen alive on December 4 in the village of Salmotita. On December 16, after an intensive search by the Mexican military, True's body was found in a shallow grave partially covered with rocks at the bottom of a ravine. Neither his wedding ring nor his watch had been taken, suggesting that robbery was not a motive.  On December 26, 1998, authorities arrested Juan Chivarra de la Cruz and his brother-in-law Miguel Hern·ndez de la Cruz, both Huichol Indians, and charged them with True's murder. Under questioning, Chivarra and Hernández confessed to murdering True because he had taken photographs without their permission. The journalist's belongings, including his camera, binoculars, and backpack, were found at the suspects' homes.  When the two men were brought into court, however, they acknowledged killing True but claimed they had acted in self-defense. They also claimed that their confession had been extracted under torture. Jalisco State Attorney General Gerardo Octavio Solís Gómez has repeatedly denied these claims.  Additional evidence points to the suspects' culpability. In 1999, a Newsweek reporter found a notebook belonging to True in a warehouse where case evidence was stored. In one entry, True described an encounter with a Huichol man named Juan, possibly a reference to Chivarra.  Both suspects have repeatedly given contradictory statements in interviews with the San Antonio Express-News. While they initially contended that they had never seen True, they later admitted to meeting him. Then in an interview published on August 8, 2001, both men claimed they had seen the journalist but never talked to him.  Mexican authorities have issued three separate forensic reports since True's body was found. The first, based on an autopsy by Jalisco State medical examiners, found that True had been strangled with his own bandana and sustained a head injury that was not attributable to a fall.  The second report, based on an autopsy by the Federal Attorney General's Office, concluded that True died from blows to his head and body and from edema (accumulation of fluid in the lungs), most likely after suffering an accidental fall caused by heavy drinking. Both autopsies found a high concentration of alcohol in True's blood, a finding consistent with advanced decomposition, according to forensic experts consulted by the Express-News.  It remains unclear why federal authorities ordered a second autopsy. True's already decomposed body was essentially dismembered during the first autopsy, making the possibility of drawing accurate conclusions from a second autopsy difficult at best.  In March 2000, the third forensic report, which is required under Mexican law when two autopsies yield different results, found that True's death was caused by a pulmonary edema resulting from a head injury. This conclusion was based solely on the examiner's analysis of the first two autopsy reports.  On August 3, 2001, Mexican Judge José Luis Reyes Contreras acquitted Chivarra and Hernández and ordered their release. On August 7, Jalisco Attorney General Solís Gómez said there was enough evidence to convict the two men and added that he would appeal the verdict.  Judge Reyes Contreras has been quoted as saying that his decision to release the men was based on the second autopsy report, which concluded that True's death was accidental. The judge's ruling did not account for the fact that True's belongings were found in the two suspects' homes or that his body was hidden in a grave near the death site.  The Jalisco State Attorney General's Office appealed the acquittals in a September 25, 2001, hearing before a panel of three magistrates from the State Supreme Court of Justice. On May 30, 2002, a three-judge appeals panel sentenced Chivarra and Hernández to 13-year prison terms for True's murder. The unanimous ruling overturned an August 2001 verdict that had acquitted the two men.  In February 2003, a federal court overturned the 13-year sentences on procedural grounds. In November 2003, both the private investigator who worked to win the release of the men and the U.S. citizen who funded portions of their defense said Chivarra and Hernández had privately confessed to killing True and should be brought to justice.  On April 27, 2004, a three-judge panel of the Jalisco State Supreme Court convicted the men, sentenced them to 20 years in prison each, and ordered each to pay 117,315 Mexican pesos (U$10,000) in damages, Jorge Ochoa, the lawyer of True's widow, Martha True, told CPJ.  The ruling, issued by judges Celso Rodríguez González, Gustavo Flores Martínez, and Guillermo Valdez Angulo, also ordered the capture of the two men, who are now free on bond and are believed to be living in the area of Sierra Madre.  Chivarra and Herná ndez can file an appeal (recurso de amparo), but Ochoa told CPJ he doubts they will."},{"id":1452,"location":"France","year":"2015","name":"Philippe Honoré","organization":"Freelance","date":"January 7, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Paris","job":"Columnist / Commentator","medium":"Print, Internet","coverage":"Culture, Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Partial Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Honoré, a cartoonist with the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo who was known by his penname Honoré, was shot dead in an attack on the Paris offices of the paper by heavily armed gunmen, according to news reports.\nParis prosecutor François Molins told reporters that two men wearing black balaclavas and armed with Kalashnikov machine guns entered the newsroom around 11:30 a.m., The Guardian reported. At the entrance, the attackers killed one person--whom Molins did not name--and proceeded to the second floor, where a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting was taking place, reports said.\nThe Guardian reported that among the victims were Honoré; Moustapha Ourrad, a copy editor for the paper; Elsa Cayat, a columnist; Stephane Charbonnier, editor of Charlie Hebdo; Bernard Maris, a shareholder and columnist who wrote under the penname \"Uncle Bernard\"; and cartoonists Jean Cabut, known as Cabu; Georges Wolinski; and Bernard Verlhac, known as Tignous.\nFollowing the attack, the killers fled to the street, where they shot and killed a police officer before getting away in a black car, reports said.\nNo organization immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. News reports cited witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and referred to the Prophet Muhammad. \nHonoré often wrote about literary and political issues and contributed to several other French outlets, including Lire, Le Magazine Littéraire, and Le Monde. His last cartoon depicted in black and white the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nCharlie Hebdo has been under threat from Islamic extremists and under police protection since the magazine was fire-bombed in 2011, a day after it published a caricature of the Prophet Muhammad and a spoof edition \"guest edited\" by the Prophet, according to news reports.\nThe attack occurred in a highly tense and politically volatile climate in a country confronted with the departure of hundreds of French citizens to fight with Islamic militants in Syria and Iraq; controversies around the place of Islam in French society; and the rise of the nationalist political party National Front, which topped the May 2014 elections to the European Parliament.\nCharlie Hebdo's most recent cover featured a cartoon on writer Michel Houellebecq, whose new book published the same day as the attack, Soumission (Submission), imagined the victory of a Muslim president by 2022 in France, according to news reports.\nIn the days following the attack, police identified two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, as the gunmen, according to news reports. On January 9, 2015, following a standoff with police during which the brothers held one hostage, the two were shot dead in a printing warehouse northeast of Paris, news reports said. The hostage was freed. On the same day, police also shot dead Amedy Coulibaly, who had taken hostages at a supermarket in Paris on January 9 and was accused of having killed a police officer the day before, news reports said.\nCoulibaly and Chérif Kouachi were both followers of Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian who served a 10-year prison term in France in 2001 for participating in a plot to bomb the U.S. embassy, according to news reports. \nOn January 14, 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility for the attack, according to news reports. The statement said the attack was ordered by Al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri and was in response to the publication's caricatures of Prophet Muhammad."},{"id":1453,"location":"Somalia","year":"1994","name":"Pierre Anceaux","organization":"Freelance","date":"August 31, 1994","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Baidoa","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"Human Rights","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Anceaux, a Swiss journalist on assignment with the charity group CARITAS-Switzerland, was shot and killed in a CARITAS-run refugee camp in Baidoa, southwest of Mogadishu.

In early 2015, he was also under investigation for money laundering.

His brother, Héctor Julio Alfonso Lopez, is a former congressman and senator.\nOn December 31, 2014, Alfonso López was convicted on charges of ordering the murder of Prins, according to news reports. A Bogotá judge sentenced him to 39 years in prison and ordered him to pay more than $1 million in fines.

Orient News reported that minutes before they were killed, the three journalists passed government forces in the village of Qarfa on their way to Sheikh Miskeen. Orient News and Siraj Press, another opposition news outlet, reported that the missile was launched from Qarfa, about two miles from Sheikh Miskeen. It was not clear how the outlets determined the origin of the missile.\nThe car was not marked as a press vehicle, but Orient News said it was identifiable because it was carrying a satellite dish nearly 6 feet in diameter.\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists could not independently verify the claim that a missile directly targeted the car.

The committee said that IDF forces fired mortar shells in response to enemy fire, not realizing that a previous round of IDF mortar fire had struck a civilian building and led to civilians, including journalists, to gather in the area despite previous orders to evacuate. The committee said that aerial surveillance was unavailable at the time but previous surveillance had not spotted civilians and that mortar shells were chosen in lieu of more powerful artillery shells to minimize collateral damage. The committee also said it could not rule out the possibility that some of the casualties that day resulted from Palestinian fire.\nThe final report of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, published in June 2015, cast doubt on whether the IDF took full precautions in minimizing civilian casualties in this instance, specifically questioning why the IDF did not have real-time aerial surveillance and did not use weapons more precise than mortar rounds. It concluded that the incident may have violated the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks."},{"id":1492,"location":"Russia","year":"1996","name":"Ramzan Khadzhiev","organization":"Russian public tv (ort)","date":"August 11, 1996","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Grozny","job":"Producer","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Khadzhiev, chief of the Northern Caucasus bureau of Russian Public Television (ORT), was fatally shot while attempting to leave Grozny by car with his wife and young son.

According to the video and news reports, Aliyev said he received a phone call from an individual who claimed to be related to Huseynov.

She had been badly beaten around the face and ribs and had been strangled to death, according to news reports. The state attorney general, Amadeo Flores Espinoza, said in a news briefing that it appeared her TV, cellphones, and computer had been stolen.\nMartínez had worked for the national magazine Proceso for more than 10 years and was known for her in-depth reporting on drug cartels and the links between organized crime and government officials. In the week before her murder, she covered the arrest of an allegedly high-ranking leader of the Zetas; the arrests of nine police officers charged with working for a cartel; and the story of a local mayor who was arrested with other alleged cartel gunmen after a shootout with the Mexican Army, according to news reports.\nMartínez' colleagues said she had not told them about any threats prior to her death. Two days after the murder, a state spokesperson, Gina Domínguez, said that authorities would look into Martínez' journalism as a possible motive.\nSince Martínez's death, Proceso has alleged that the most likely motive for her murder was the journalist's critical reporting on state officials. Officials have denied the claim.\nThe office of the state governor, Javier Duarte de Ochoa, ordered a special group of agents to investigate the murder. Proceso stated on its website that the state government had granted the magazine staff access to any information resulting from the investigation. The magazine also said that its executives had told the governor they were skeptical that the investigation would succeed because of the systemic dysfunction in the country.\nIn November 2012, the state attorney general announced that Jorge Antonio Hernández Silva had confessed and that robbery was the motive. But in his first court appearance, Hernández claimed he had been tortured and his family threatened if he did not make a false confession. Hernández was convicted in April 2013 and sentenced to 38 years in prison, but four months later judges voted to vacate the sentence, citing irregularities.\nIn April, Proceso reported a plot by officials in the government of Veracruz to harm Jorge Carrasco, senior editor with the magazine, who had reported extensively on Martínez's murder. A source close to the case who asked to remain anonymous told CPJ that there had been a plan under way to kill Carrasco, and that men were looking for him in Mexico City. Carrasco went into hiding with federal government protection. Proceso later published a letter from the Veracruz state attorney general's office, calling the accusations \"unfounded.\"\nWhile Governor Duarte made efforts in public statements to cast the state as a safe place for the press, under his tenure Veracruz became one of the most dangerous states for journalists in Mexico. At least eight journalists had been murdered since he took office in late 2010, and many more fled--permanently or temporarily--not only because of threats from organized crime but also from state government officials, according to CPJ research."},{"id":1503,"location":"Pakistan","year":"2012","name":"Rehmatullah Abid","organization":"Dunya news tv, Intikhaab","date":"November 18, 2012","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Panjgur","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Camera Operator, Print Reporter","medium":"Print, Television","coverage":"Business, Corruption, Crime, Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Unknown Fire","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle killed Abid in a barber\nshop in Panjgur district, about 375 miles (600 kilometers) from Quetta.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army.

Flores said the most recent threats had been made in anonymous phone calls the week before the shooting.

Morales' companion was wounded, according to local news reports.\n\n  Police compiled a list of possible suspects in mid-July that included several police officers assigned to Polomolok, the Inquirer News Service reported.\n\n  Police cited Morales' crusading anti-drug commentaries as the likely motive for his murder, but Chief Inspector Rex Anongos, head of the Polomolok police, told the MindaNews wire service that police had not ruled out personal motives for the killing.\n\n  In August, police in General Santos City arrested and filed murder charges against two suspects in Morales' murder, including the alleged mastermind.\n\n  Morales, 43, hosted a weekly \"block-time\" program called \"Voice of the Village\" on Radyo Agong, a Radio Mindanao Network affiliate, and he was known for his tough commentaries, Mangila said. He accused local politicians of corruption and involvement in the illegal drug trade. Morales, who had been broadcasting since 2003, was active with a neighborhood anticrime task force and reported its findings on the air, the Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility reported. The ABS-CBN news Web site reported that Morales also accused local officials of involvement in summary executions.\n\n  Morales worked as an inspector at the Dole pineapple plantation and held local office before starting his radio work, CMFR reported.\n\n  Morales' wife, Floreta, told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that her husband had received several death threats by text message beginning in November 2004 because of his crusade against illegal drugs. She said that he continued to broadcast despite the threats \"because it was a public service,\" and that he worked at the radio station on a volunteer basis.\n\n  Emir Bariquit, program director of DXMD Radyo Agong told the Inquirer News Service that Morales was likely killed for his fiery commentary. Bariquit said he saw a threatening letter sent to Morales a few months ago, warning the commentator to halt his criticism of local officials and illegal drugs."},{"id":1544,"location":"Guatemala","year":"2009","name":"Rolando Santiz","organization":"Telecentro 13","date":"April 1, 2009","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Guatemala City","freelance":"No","description":"Reporter Santiz and cameraman Antonio de León were driving\nto Telecentro 13’s offices in Guatemala\n  City just after 5 p.m. when two gunmen on a motorcycle\nfired several times at their car, according to local news reports and CPJ\ninterviews.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia.

One of the victims, Nadia Vera, was a friend of Espinosa's and a student activist in Xalapa, the Veracruz online publication Plumas Libres reported.\nEspinosa fled Veracruz state and arrived in Mexico City in June 2015, he told CPJ in an interview that month. He worked for the local news agency AVC Noticias, the national newsweekly Proceso, and photo agency Cuartoscuro and often covered local activist causes, local journalists told CPJ.\nEspinosa had been threatened repeatedly in the past few years. He told CPJ in June that he fled Veracruz after he noticed people outside his home in Xalapa three separate times who gave him intimidating glances and gestures. He said that in 2013, he was among the journalists attacked by police during a September 2013 eviction of protesting teachers and students. In 2012, he said, an unidentified man \"grabbed me by the shirt, threw me up against a metal curtain and told me, 'Stop taking photos ... if you don't want to end up like Regina Martínez.'\"\nRegina Martínez Pérez, the Veracruz correspondent for Proceso, was killed in April 2012 after critical reporting on state officials.\nEspinosa had clashed in previous years with authorities in Veracruz. He told the news website Sin Embargo that local authorities had been angered by a front-page photo he had taken of Veracruz Gov. Javier Duarte de Ochoa that was published in Proceso on February 15, 2014, under the headline \"Veracruz: Lawless State.\"\nBefore fleeing to Mexico City, Espinosa was very active within a group of Veracruz journalists who called on state authorities to investigate crimes against murdered journalists, a Mexican journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity told CPJ. \"He became one of the leaders of the group and represented them in meeting with authorities,\" the journalist said.\nOn August 4, authorities in Mexico City arrested Daniel Pacheco Gutiérrez, who they said was a suspect in connection with the killing, prosecutor Rodolfo Rios Garza announced. Investigators said his fingerprints had been found at the crime scene and matched to a database which showed he had a criminal record for rape and assault, the BBC reported.\nAccording to press reports, Pacheco said he had been in the apartment but that he hadn't participated in the murders. In a statement he gave to prosecutors, he said he had been invited by an individual named José Abraham to meet a Colombian woman he knew in that neighborhood. On August 11, the national daily Reforma reported that Pacheco had identified two accomplices: Abraham, who Pacheco said was a former Mexico City police officer and guarded parked cars in the streets in exchange for money, and an individual known as Omar, who he said was a juggler who performed at traffic intersections.\nPacheco was accused of murder, femicide, and aggravated robbery. The other two men were fugitives.\nWhen interrogated by a Mexican judge, Pacheco alleged he had been tortured and beaten, the local press reported. A photograph of Pacheco in custody, which was released to the press, showed the left side of his face swollen, according to press reports.\nInvestigators said they had not disregarded any motive in the multiple homicide, including Espinosa's work. But local journalists and activists said that authorities were not looking into the photographer's work or the threats he had received. They also pointed out inconsistencies in the investigation: Investigators said the murders took place sometime between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., but Espinosa's final text messages, obtained by The Associated Press, show that he was still alive at 2:13 p.m.\nVeracruz is one of the most dangerous states for the press in Mexico, according to CPJ research.

The station broadcast an interview with Talal at that time, in which he vowed to continue his work for the channel.

Rayan was at the market to cover Palestinian citizens shopping for basic necessities during a four-hour truce called by the Israeli military, Abu Foul said. Mohammed Nour al-Din al-Deiri, a Palestinian media worker for the Palestine Network for Press and Media, was killed in the attack that day, according to reports and his father, who spoke to CPJ.\nAt least two other journalists were injured in the strikes. Abu Foul told CPJ that the network's editor, Mahmoud al-Qasas, had been badly injured in the strike and was hospitalized with head injuries. The local Al-Manara media agency said its cameraman, Hamid al-Shobaky, was also injured and hospitalized.\nA graphic video posted by Al-Manara on its Facebook page shows repeated explosions rocking Shijaiyah, as the injured cry out for help amid ringing sirens. At the beginning of the video, Rayan is seen filming as ambulances arrive. By the end, he lies dead on the street among other victims. According to CNN, the video came from Al-Shobaky's camera. After he was injured, his assistant picked up the camera and continued to film.\nAn internal IDF committee led by investigators who had not been part of the chain of command during the incident found that the \"tragic\" civilian deaths on July 30 were the result of \"a number of coincidences and series of events that a military commander should not be expected to predict,\" according to a statement published in March 2015. The committee said that IDF forces fired mortar shells in response to enemy fire, not realizing that a previous round of IDF mortar fire had struck a civilian building and led to civilians, including journalists, to gather in the area despite previous orders to evacuate. The committee said that aerial surveillance was unavailable at the time but previous surveillance had not spotted civilians and that mortar shells were chosen in lieu of more powerful artillery shells to minimize collateral damage. The committee also said it could not rule out the possibility that some of the casualties that day resulted from Palestinian fire.\nThe final report of the U.N. Independent Commission of Inquiry on the 2014 Gaza Conflict, published in June 2015, cast doubt on whether the IDF took full precautions in minimizing civilian casualties in this instance, specifically questioning why the IDF did not have real-time aerial surveillance and did not use weapons more precise than mortar rounds. It concluded that the incident may have violated the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks."},{"id":1606,"location":"Syria","year":"2016","name":"Samer Mohammed Aboud","organization":"Free deir al-zour radio, Development interaction network","date":"October 2015 - June 2016","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Deir al-Zour","job":"Broadcast Reporter, Internet Reporter","medium":"Radio, Internet","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Militants from the Islamic State group murdered Samer Mohammed Aboud, a radio journalist and writer in Deir al-Zour, Syria, his colleague confirmed to the Committee to Protect Journalists following the release of a graphic video showing his murder.

Purohit told CPJ that he took Sharma to the local hospital where the journalist was declared dead from injuries sustained in the crash.Purohit said both he and Sharma began receiving death threats last year after publishing two stories in July and October 2017 on alleged police corruption and illegal sand mining. The journalists shot a video that showed how a senior police officer accepted a bribe to allow the movement of vehicles carrying illegally mined sand, according to a report in the Indian Express newspaper. With strong demand for construction in India, illegal sand mining has increasingly become a problem because sand is difficult to transport and \"regulatory consequences are minimal\" for extracting it from off-limits areas, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.Purohit said local residents came to him and Sharma and said they would “crush them under a truck” for doing the stories. The villagers would also pass by the house when the journalists were home to intimidate them, Purohit said.Prashant Khare, the Bhind police superintendent, told CPJ that police were examining CCTV footage and that they had arrested the truck driver who hit Sharma. “A special investigation team has been formed to investigate whether this was an accident or it was a murder,” Khare said. Purohit told CPJ that about 10 days after News World aired Sharma's October investigation, the journalist was \"beaten up by a bunch of goons but was saved thanks to the presence of police.\" He said the thugs they didn’t specifically mention the report. According to Purohit, Sharma filed a formal complaint to the police about the beating, but they did not take further action. The News World bureau chief also said that he and Sharma wrote letters to government authorities, including the state's inspector general of police, to ask for government protection after they began receiving death threats, but they received no response.Khare confirmed that police received letters from Purohit and Sharma in December complaining about the threats.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":1625,"location":"Sierra Leone","year":"2000","name":"Saoman Conteh","organization":"New tablet","date":"May 8, 2000","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Dangerous Assignment","specificlocation":"Freetown","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Human Rights","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Paramilitary Group","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Conteh, a journalist with the independent weekly New Tablet, was shot dead while covering a spontaneous demonstration outside the Freetown residence of Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebel leader Foday Sankoh.Sankoh's bodyguards opened fire on a crowd of people who were protesting the RUF's May 3 abduction of United Nations peacekeepers.

According to Thai journalists, there were other long-standing differences among the men, including allegations of theft lodged by the gunman against others in the group.The dinner at the floating restaurant was supposedly organized so that the men could settle their differences.Officials of the Thai Journalists Association say that the incident in Mukdahan might be related to the journalists' illegal business activities. It is not uncommon in Thailand for provincial newspaper stringers, who are notoriously underpaid, to use their positions to solicit bribes or to gain favors with local officials. Mukdahan is a center for a thriving border trade with neighboring Laos, which may also have played a role in the killing, according to Thai journalists.

Mirza Karo, a friend of the journalist who was cited in reports as saying the pair had been on a hunting trip at the time of Zaynadin's death, took the family to his body on December 1, according to reports.\n\nAuthorities have given conflicting accounts of how the journalist died, according to local human rights group 17Shubat and the Kurdish media network Rudaw TV. The family and news reports that cited initial police and medical statements said that Zaynadin was shot. Later police and medical reports said that the journalist was killed by a wild animal and that no gunshot wounds were found on the body, according to news reports and the family.\n\nThe journalist's family told CPJ through a translator that Zaynadin had been missing for two days before Karo came to their home to tell them he died while hunting. The family said that Zaynadin had never previously left on a trip without telling them where he was going.\n\nZaynadin worked for KNN, a Kurdistan-based television and online news agency closely affiliated with Kurdistan's opposition Change (Gorran) Movement party. The journalist's son, Qahraman Zaynadin, told CPJ that his father had been threatened several times because of his affiliation with the station--where he had been working since 2011--and the Change Movement. The son said that four days before the journalist died, an anonymous caller phoned Zaynadin and threatened to kill him if he did not leave KNN. Zaynadin received similar death threats two months before that, Qahraman Zaynadin said.\n\nQahraman Zaynadin said that his father had been working on a report about Turkish airstrikes along the Turkey-Iraq border area, a sensitive issue in Iraqi Kurdistan. In 2013, Zaynadin was detained by the Kurdish Democratic Party's security forces due to his employment with KNN, the channel reported. It did not provide further details.\n\nRagaz Kamal Mohammed Ali, the co-founder of 17Shubat for Human Rights, told CPJ that he had spoken with Karo about Zaynadin's death. Karo told him that after the friends became separated during a hunting trip he heard two gunshots and Zaynadin shouting for help, followed by two additional gunshots. Karo told Ali that he found Zaynadin dead 20 minutes later.\n\nKaro works for the Zeravani, the regional government's militarized police force, Ali told CPJ.\n\nA technical issue prevented CPJ from immediately contacting Karo for comment.\n\nAli said that Duhok police and the Commission of Doctors, an official organization within the Kurdistan regional government, changed their conclusion of how Zaynadin died three times and prevented KNN staff from seeing Zaynadin's body at the hospital. Ali, who has spoken with the journalist's son, told CPJ that the Commission of Doctors initially told the family Zaynadin was shot, but that doctors later called the family to say he was killed by a wild animal. The official autopsy report states he was killed by an animal, the family and Ali said. A medical examination citied in news reports stated that Zaynadin was killed by an animal and made no mention of gun injuries.\n\nSome outlets reported that Zaynadin's family said initially that the journalist accidentally shot himself or that he had been killed by a wild animal. One report published a photo of a boar that it said was found near to where Zaynadin died. The journalist's family told CPJ they had been misquoted in earlier news reports about the cause of Zaynadin's death and that they believe he was killed for his work with KNN and the Change Movement.\n\nCPJ's 2014 report, \"Mountain of Impunity Looms Over Kurdistan Journalists\" found journalists in the region are at risk of beatings, kidnap, and threats, with attackers often going unpunished. Journalists interviewed for the report said the climate of impunity makes it risky to cover sensitive issues.\n\nAt a meeting between KNN and Roueida El Hage, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq Human Rights Office in the Kurdistan Region, El Hage told the channel the U.N. would investigate Zaynadin's death, the channel reported in December 2016.\nThe mission's office did not immediately respond to CPJ's emailed request for comment."},{"id":1683,"location":"Bangladesh","year":"2002","name":"Shukur Hossain","organization":"Anirban","date":"July 5, 2002","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Ula","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"Yes","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Hossain, a crime reporter for the Khulna-based newspaper Anirban, was kidnapped from his home in Ula, a village near the town of Dumuria, Khulna District, at around midnight by a group of about 35 armed men.

BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was critically injured in the attack, which left him partly paralyzed.\nCumbers was with Gardner, a driver, and a minder, assigned by the Saudi Ministry of Information, as he filmed a house belonging to an Al-Qaeda militant killed by Saudi police in 2003, according to news reports.\nAccording to Gardner's 2006 book Blood and Sand, the crew originally agreed to spend no more than 10 minutes in Al-Suwaidi, given the district's reputation for its strong Al-Qaeda presence. At the time, the government minder did not express concern for the safety of the crew, so Cumbers and Gardner decided to stay for another 30 minutes to film multiple takes, Gardner wrote. As they were about to pack up and leave, a young Saudi male dressed in the traditional white thobe got out from his car and approached the crew. He greeted Gardner, saying in Arabic \"Peace be upon you,\" to which Gardner replied with the traditional \"And upon you the peace and mercy of God and his blessings.\" The man hesitated a moment, pulled out a pistol, and began to fire.\nGardner wrote that he tried to run away, but was hit in the shoulder. A second round struck him in the leg and he fell to the ground in front of a second group of gunmen who were inside a minivan and had opened fire on him. One of the shooters then rifled through his pockets before the group left the scene. Gardner wrote that he lay bleeding on the ground for more than a half-hour before police drove him to a hospital.\nIn a meeting in 2005, Saudi detectives told Gardner that Cumbers died as he got into the van to try and escape, Gardner wrote in his book. News reports said Cumbers was shot in the head. The detectives said that the driver and the government minder survived.\nThe Saudi detectives told Gardner that six gunmen had undertaken the operation, according to the book. The detectives said that members of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were headed to meet Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the head of the group, in the Al-Suwaidi neighborhood when they spotted the TV crew. The detectives said that al-Muqrin gave the order to kill the journalists.\nThe detectives told Gardner that the gunman who first shot him was named Abdullah al-Subaei, but that it was Faisal al-Dakheel, a senior member of the group, who fired again at Gardner from the minivan.\nAl-Muqrin and al-Dakheel were killed in a shootout with security forces on June 18, 2004, in Al-Suwaidi, according to news reports. At least three other expatriates were killed in the 12 days between Cumbers' murder and the shootout, according to Jihad in Saudi Arabia, a 2010 book written by scholar Thomas Heghammer. Three of the other assailants were also killed in clashes with security forces.\nThe sixth member of the attackers, Adel al-Dhubaiti, was arrested in 2005, Gardner told CPJ. In the 2005 meeting with Gardner, the Saudi detectives told him that al-Dhubaiti was the gunman who shot Cumbers.\nOn November 18, 2014, the Saudi Specialized Criminal Court sentenced al-Dhubaiti to death for his role in multiple Al-Qaeda attacks, including the murder of Cumbers, according to news reports. Two other defendants, members of Al-Qaeda, were sentenced to death and five others were sentenced to up to 30 years' imprisonment, the reports said.\nThe Saudi embassy in the United States and the Saudi Ministry of Justice did not respond to CPJ's requests in late 2014 for comment. Gardner told CPJ in an email shortly after the sentence that the Saudi government had provided him and the Cumbers family with \"absolutely ZERO information about the trial.\" He added that the Saudi government had never apologized nor paid any compensation to his or Cumbers' family for what he said was Saudi incompetence in both ensuring security for the crew and handling the aftermath of the shooting.\nCumbers' father, Robert, said in a statement after the November 2014 sentencing that he had \"mixed feelings\" about the issuing of a death sentence. He said he was relieved the wait was over but expressed sympathy to Al-Dhubaiti's parents.\nOn January 2, 2016, the Saudi Ministry of Interior said in a statement it had executed 47 prisoners, including al-Dhubaiti. The list of executed prisoners mostly included those accused of carrying out attacks on behalf of Al-Qaeda."},{"id":1688,"location":"Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory","year":"2014","name":"Simone Camilli","organization":"The associated press","date":"August 13, 2014","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Beit Lahiya","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer","medium":"Television, Internet","coverage":"Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Simone Camilli, an Italian video journalist for The Associated Press, was killed when an unexploded missile blew up in the northern Gaza Strip, according to his employer.

At the entrance, the attackers killed one person--whom Molins did not name--and proceeded to the second floor, where a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting was taking place, reports said.\nThe Guardian reported that among the victims were Charb; Bernard Maris, a shareholder and columnist who wrote under the penname \"Uncle Bernard\"; cartoonists Jean Cabut, known as Cabu; Georges Wolinski; and Bernard Verlhac, known as Tignous; Moustapha Ourrad, a copy editor and proofreader for the weekly; and Elsa Cayat and Philippe Honoré, columnists for the paper.\nFollowing the attack, the killers fled to the street, where they shot and killed a police officer before getting away in a black car, reports said.\nNo organization immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. News reports cited witnesses as saying the gunmen shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and referred to the Prophet Muhammad.\nCharb, 47, a well-known cartoonist, had worked with Charlie Hebdo for more than 20 years and began helming the weekly in 2012, according to news reports. He had received death threats and had been under police protection since 2011, news reports said.

On January 9, 2015, following a standoff with police during which the brothers held one hostage, the two were shot dead in a printing warehouse northeast of Paris, news reports said. The hostage was freed. On the same day, police also shot dead Amedy Coulibaly, who had taken hostages at a supermarket in Paris on January 9 and was accused of having killed a police officer the day before, news reports said.\nCoulibaly and Chérif Kouachi were both followers of Djamel Beghal, a French-Algerian who served a 10-year prison term in France in 2001 for participating in a plot to bomb the U.S. embassy, according to news reports.\nOn January 14, 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in Yemen, issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility for the attack, according to news reports.

At around 12 p.m., a shell hit two hotel balconies where several journalists were monitoring a battle in the vicinity. José Couso, a cameraman for the Spanish television station Telecinco, also died in the attack.\n\nAgence France-Presse reported that Protsyuk died of wounds to his head and stomach. He had worked for Reuters since 1993, covering conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. He was married with an 8-year-old son.\n\nDirectly after the attack, Maj. Gen. Buford Blount, commander of the U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division, confirmed that a single shell had been fired at the hotel from a tank in response to what he said was rocket and small arms fire from the building. Journalists at the hotel denied that any gunfire had emanated from the building.\n\nA CPJ report concluded that the shelling of the hotel, while not deliberate, was avoidable since U.S. commanders knew that journalists were present in the hotel and were intent on not hitting it. The report called on the Pentagon to conduct a thorough and public investigation into the incident.\n\nOn August 12, U.S. Central Command (Centcom) issued a news release summarizing the results of its investigation into the incident. The report concluded that the tank unit that opened fire on the hotel did so \"in a proportionate and justifiably measured response.\" It called the shelling \"fully in accordance with the Rules of Engagement.\"\n\nCentcom offered some detail-consistent with CPJ's investigation-that the tank opened fire at what it believed was an Iraqi \"spotter\" directing enemy fire at U.S. troops. The release also explained that \"one 120mm tank round was fired at the suspected enemy observer position. ... It was only some time after the incident that A Company became aware of the fact that the building they fired on was the Palestine Hotel and that journalists at the hotel had been killed or injured as a result.\"\n\nHowever, the news release failed to address one of the conclusions in CPJ's report: That U.S. commanders knew that journalists were in the Palestine Hotel but failed to convey this knowledge to forces on the ground.\n\nCentcom's results, which were summarized in the release, appeared to back away from earlier charges by U.S. military officials that the tank unit was responding to hostile fire emanating from the hotel. Yet, despite considerable testimony to the contrary from several journalists in the hotel, Centcom maintains \"that the enemy used portions of the hotel as a base of operations and that heavy enemy activity was occurring in those areas in and immediately around the hotel.\"\n\nIn addition, the news release failed to provide other specific information, such as how the decision to target the hotel was made.\n\nCPJ has urged Centcom to make the full report available, but a Centcom spokesperson told CPJ the report is classified. CPJ is still waiting for the Defense Department to fulfill a Freedom of Information Act request related to the incident that CPJ filed in May."},{"id":1742,"location":"Iraq","year":"2003","name":"Tareq Ayyoub","organization":"Al-jazeera","date":"April 8, 2003","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Baghdad","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Foreign","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Ayyoub, a Jordanian national working with the Qatar-based satellite\nchannel Al-Jazeera, was killed when a U.S. missile struck the station's\nBaghdad bureau, which was located in a two-story villa in a residential\narea near the Iraqi Information Ministry and the former presidential\npalace compound of Saddam Hussein. Al-Jazeera cameraman Zouhair Nadhim,\nwho was outside on the building's roof with Ayyoub, was injured in the\nblast, which targeted a small electric generator outside the building.\n\nCentcom maintains that U.S. forces were responding to enemy fire in the\narea and that the Al-Jazeera journalists were caught in the crossfire.\nAl-Jazeera correspondents deny that any fire came from their building.\n\nThe attack occurred during heavy fighting around the bureau in an area\nthat housed government buildings targeted by U.S. and coalition forces.\nAl-Jazeera officials pointed out that the U.S. military had been given\nthe bureau's exact coordinates weeks before the war began.\n\nIn an April 8 letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, CPJ\nprotested the bombing and called for an immediate investigation. In\nOctober, a Centcom spokesman confirmed to CPJ that no investigation\ninto the incident has been conducted.\n\nThe incident occurred around dawn, after intense anti-aircraft fire\nbegan in the area. Talk show host and producer Maher Abdullah, a\nfive-year Al-Jazeera veteran who had been in Baghdad for two weeks at\nthe time, told CPJ that planes began flying low in the area at around 6\na.m.\n\nThe crew went up to the roof of the building to report but retreated\nbecause they deemed it unsafe. According to Abdullah, the crew realized\nmoments later that their still camera had been knocked out of position\nand now faced the Ministry of Information building, which Iraqi\nauthorities had explicitly warned the crew not to film. Assistant\ncameraman Zoheir Nadhim returned to the roof with Ayyoub to adjust the\ncamera.\n\nWhen Ayyoub and Nadhim went up stairs, Abdullah heard a plane fly so\nlow it that sounded like it was going to crash into the building. At\nthat point, a missile struck Al-Jazeera's small generator, which was\nlocated outside the building at ground level just below where Ayyoub\nwas believed to have been at the time. Two Al-Jazeera correspondents\nsaid that while they suspect that the strike caused his death, he could\nhave been killed by other ordnance.\n\nAnother plane passed low about 15 minutes later and fired another\nmissile, which struck across the road about 50 feet (15 meters) from\nthe front door, blowing it off the hinges, according to Abdullah.\n\nRaed Khattar, a cameraman for Abu Dhabi TV who, at the time, was\noutside on the nearby roof of Abu Dhabi TV's office, saw what was\nlikely the first missile because his office was between the plane and\nAl-Jazeera's office, he told CPJ.\nMoments later, Abu Dhabi TV staff on the roof came\nunder machine gun fire from a U.S. tank on the nearby Jumhuriyya\nBridge, and one of their three unmanned cameras was struck by a shell,\nstaff told CPJ. The three-story building was marked with a large banner\nlabeled \"Abu Dhabi TV.\"\n\nIn a statement issued hours after the incident, Centcom in Doha, Qatar,\nsaid that, \"According to commanders on the ground, Coalition forces\ncame under significant enemy fire from the building where the\nAl-Jazeera journalists were working and consistent with the right of\nself-defense, Coalition forces returned fire. Sadly an Al-Jazeera\ncorrespondent was killed in this exchange.\"\n\nAbdullah noted that until that morning anti-aircraft fire in the area\nhad been sporadic. Days before April 8, Abdullah saw manned Iraqi\nanti-aircraft positions in the general vicinity-some 220 yards (200\nmeters) away on the opposite side of the generator, but not immediately\nnear the office. However, on April 11, he discovered one abandoned\nanti-aircraft gun about 44 yards (40 meters) away from the bureau.\nJournalists from Abu Dhabi TV told CPJ that Al-Jazeera's bureau was\nlocated near a villa used by former Iraqi Information Minister Muhammad\nSaid Sahhaf.\n\nJust before the war, CPJ obtained a copy of the February 24, 2003,\nletter that then Al-Jazeera Managing Director Mohammed Jasem al-Ali had\nsent to the Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke specifying the\ncoordinates of the bureau.\n\nAl-Jazeera also maintains that the night before the strike, al-Ali had\nreceived explicit assurances from U.S. State Department official Nabeel\nKhoury in Doha, Qatar, that the bureau was safe and would not be\ntargeted. Abdullah told CPJ, \"The coordinates were actually given four\nmonths in advance to the Pentagon, and we were assured that we would\nnot be hit under any circumstances. ... We would never be targeted,\nthat was the assurance.\"\n\nIn an e-mail reply to CPJ, Khoury, who said he did not recall the exact\ndate of his meeting with Al-Jazeera, said, \"I doubt very much that I\nassured anybody's safety in a war zone.\" He added that he did tell the\nstation \"what we had been telling all diplomats and civilians, that\nwhereas our troops would do their utmost not to hurt civilians, there\nwas no way to guarantee anyone's safety in a war zone.\"\n\nIn its April 8 letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld CPJ\nalso noted that, \"The attack against Al-Jazeera is of particular\nconcern since the stations' offices were also hit in Kabul,\nAfghanistan, in November 2001. The Pentagon asserted, without providing\nadditional detail, that the office was a 'known Al-Qaeda facility,' and\nthat the U.S. military did not know the space was being used by\nAl-Jazeera.\"\n\nCPJ is still waiting for the Defense Department to fulfill a Freedom of\nInformation Act request related to the incident that CPJ filed in May."},{"id":1743,"location":"UK","year":"1995","name":"Tarsem Singh Purewal","organization":"Desh pardesh","date":"January 24, 1995","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"London","freelance":"No","description":"Purewal, editor and publisher of Punjabi-language newspaper Desh Pardesh, was shot and killed near his newspaper's office in London's Southall neighborhood.

Subsequent reports said Acharya had been threatened with death by the owner of a cashew processing plant in Khallikote, after the journalist published a report alleging child labor practices at the plant. The Hindu reported that the journalist was in possession of footage showing child laborers working under hazardous conditions.\nWhile some initial reports citing Acharya's editor and police suggested the murder may have been related to a family dispute, authorities on June 8, 2014, arrested Shyam Sundar Prusty, the owner of the cashew processing plant, and an alleged accomplice, N Ramesh Reddy, owner of a local light and sound unit, in connection with the murder, news reports said.\nPolice cited a pre-existing personal enmity between Acharya and Prusty, but said that Prusty had seen Acharya's reporting on child labor at his facility as an attempt to damage his business, according to Ashish Kumar Singh, police superintendent of Ganjam district cited in The Indian Express. Singh accused Prusty of ordering Acharya's murder, paying three friends 50,000 rupees (US$850), and providing them with three new SIM cards, according to reports.\nPolice said Prusty confessed to the murder, according to local news reports. It's not clear if Prusty has been charged.\nIn October 2014, police also arrested Sibaram Nayak, a journalist who works for the Odisha-based Eastern Media group, according to news reports.

They remain missing.\n\nThe three men, along with cameraman Daniel Demoustier, were traveling in two marked press vehicles in the town of Iman Anas, near Al-Zubayr, when they came under fire, ITN reported. According to Demoustier, the car he and Lloyd had been driving had been pursued by Iraqi troops who may have been attempting to surrender to the journalists. Demoustier reported that the incoming fire to their vehicles likely came from U.S. or British forces in the area.\n\nDemoustier, who was injured when the car he was driving crashed into a ditch and caught fire, managed to escape. He said he did not see what happened to Lloyd, who was seated next to him, or to the other crew members. Lloyd's body was recovered in a hospital in Basra days later.\n\nAn investigative article published in The Wall Street Journal in May indicated that Lloyd's SUV and another vehicle belonging to his colleagues came under fire from U.S. Marines. The article cited accounts from U.S. troops who recalled opening fire on cars marked \"TV.\" Soldiers also said they believed that Iraqi suicide bombers were using the cars to attack U.S. troops.\n\nThe Journal article cited a report from a British security firm commissioned by ITN to investigate the incident saying that Lloyd's car was hit by both coalition and Iraqi fire;the latter most likely came from behind the car, possibly after the vehicle had crashed.\n\nThe report concluded that \"[t]he Iraqis no doubt mounted an attack using the ITN crew as cover, or perhaps stumbled into the U.S. forces whilst attempting to detain the ITN crew.\" The report also speculated that the missing men-Nerac and Othman, who were last seen by Demoustier in another car being stopped by Iraqi forces-might have been pulled out of their car before it came under fire from coalition forces, and then Iraqi forces used the SUV to attack the coalition forces.\n\nIn April, Nerac's wife approached U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell at a NATO press conference, and he promised to do everything in his power to find out what had happened to the missing men. In late May, Centcom said that it was investigating the incident, while the British Ministry of Defense promised to open an inquiry.

Aglan told the newspaper that he had picked up a lightly wounded Lloyd, who had suffered only a shoulder injury, and attempted to take him to a hospital in Basra when the minibus came under fire from a U.S. helicopter, killing Lloyd. The paper reported that the bus was also carrying wounded Iraqi soldiers.\n\nAn ITN spokesperson told CPJ that a number of elements of Aglan's story are not consistent with ITN's own investigation. She said an autopsy revealed that Lloyd had suffered two serious wounds that likely resulted from Iraqi and U.S. fire. She said that after he was wounded, an Iraqi civilian in a minibus had picked up Lloyd and tried to take him to a hospital in Basra.

The militant group completely overran the city the next day.\nAl-Ali was not affiliated with any political parties, the editorial director for the local Nineveh Reporters Network, Mohammed al-Biyati, told the Kurdish media network Rudaw.\nWhile the Islamic State group has often publicized its murders of international journalists in highly produced videos, it has often not given the same attention to its executions of local journalists, according to CPJ research. In the weeks that al-Ali was kidnapped and murdered, the Islamic State group in Mosul released pictures and videos about military preparations in the city and the stoning of purported adulterers. There is no mention of Al-Ali's murder.\nSince the Islamic State takeover over the city, dozens of journalists have been kidnapped, many have been reportedly killed, and many more have fled the city, as described in a CPJ guest blog post by Iraqi journalist Oday Hatem. The exact toll the Islamic State has waged upon the Mosul journalism community is unclear given the difficulty of confirming information from the city."},{"id":1756,"location":"Iraq","year":"2006","name":"Thaker al-Shouwili","organization":"Al-shaabiya","date":"October 12, 2006","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Baghdad","job":"Broadcast Reporter","medium":"Television","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Masked gunmen in at least five vehicles drove up to the fledgling satellite TV channel Al-Shaabiya in the eastern district of Zayouna around 7 a.m., burst into the offices, executed 11 people, and wounded two others.

His driver met him there at around 8 p.m., but the journalist said he needed more time to finish his work. They agreed to meet again at 10 p.m., but Lopes never arrived. This was Lopes' fourth visit to Vila Cruzeiro, and he was carrying a hidden camera.\n\n According to TV Globo, Lopes was working on a report about parties hosted by drug traffickers in Vila Cruzeiro that allegedly involved drugs and the sexual exploitation of minors. Favela residents had told Lopes that they were powerless against drug traffickers and had complained about the lack of police action.\n\n On June 3, TV Globo reported Lopes' disappearance to the police.\n\n According to the Rio de Janeiro Civil Police, two suspects, both members of a gang headed by local drug trafficker Elias Pereira da Silva, also known as \"Crazy Elias,\" were arrested on the morning of June 9. Both men claimed that they heard how Lopes was murdered but denied any involvement in his killing.\n\n According to the suspects' depositions, details of which the police released and the Brazilian press published, drug traffickers close to Pereira da Silva kidnapped Lopes in Vila Cruzeiro at around midnight on June 2. After Lopes told them he was a TV Globo reporter, the traffickers called Pereira da Silva, who was in a nearby favela.\n\n They tied Lopes' hands, forced him into a car, and took him to the favela where Pereira da Silva was staying. There, they beat the reporter and shot him in the feet to keep him from escaping. They then held a mock trial and sentenced Lopes to death.\n\n Pereira da Silva killed Lopes with a sword, and his body was burned and put in a hidden burial ground, said the suspects.\n\n On June 12, police found badly decomposed human remains, along with Lopes' camera and watch in Favela da Grota. After DNA tests, police confirmed on July 5 that the remains belonged to Lopes. Two days later, they were officially buried.\n\n Lopes had received Brazil's most important journalism award in December 2001 for a TV Globo report on drug trafficking. The report, titled \"Drug Fair,\" and broadcast in August 2001, was filmed with a hidden camera and showed how traffickers sold drugs in a makeshift open drug market in a favela outside Rio de Janeiro. Reporter Cristina Guimarães, who co-produced the piece with Lopes and two other colleagues, received death threats in September 2001 and had to leave Rio de Janeiro State, according to the daily O Estado de S. Paulo. The daily Jornal do Brasil reported that Lopes had also received threats for the report.\n\n On September 19, after a two-day search, police apprehended drug lord Pereira da Silva. In early August, several members of his gang who had also been charged with murdering the journalist were either arrested or killed in a shoot-out with the police. \n At year's end, Pereira da Silva and his accomplices remained in jail.

In all, 57 people were killed in a shocking display of barbarism apparently motivated by political clan rivalries. Most of the bodies were dumped in a mass hillside grave in the town of Ampatuan. A fact-finding report by four local press organizations—the Freedom Fund for Filipino Journalists, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, MindaNews, and the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism—said most of the victims had worked for Mindanao-based newspapers, with some employed by radio and television outlets. “The massacre claimed nearly an entire generation of journalists from the small print and broadcast communities of General Santos, Koronadal City, and nearby areas,” said the report, noting that most of the victims were married and had children. The entourage was on its way to Shariff Aguak to file documents in support of local political leader Esmael Mangudadatu’s candidacy for provincial governor. Having been warned of a possible ambush, Mangudadatu did not travel with the group but instead sent female family members and supporters, and invited the press to go along, in the belief that women and independent witnesses would not be attacked, according to local and foreign media reports. Police quickly identified Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay in Maguindanao and son of the provincial governor, as a prime suspect behind the killings. Ampatuan surrendered to authorities but proclaimed his innocence. Investigators said that about 100 heavily armed men loyal to Ampatuan abducted the group, took them to a more remote hillside, and then opened fire. Reuters quoted one of its photographers at the scene as saying that many bodies had both bullet and machete wounds. Some of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs, and one of the female victims was pregnant, Reuters and other sources reported. The journalists were not directly targeted for their work, but were the victims of a long- running feud between two rival political clans competing for supremacy in the area. The massacre was not linked to Mindanao’s decades-old guerrilla battle between Muslim secessionist and the Philippine army. In their fact-finding report, the four local press groups highlighted a number of concerns about the initial police investigation. The report said the crime scene had not been well preserved and that personal belongings were still strewn about several days after the massacre. The recovery effort, which relied on the use of excavation equipment, compromised forensic evidence, it added. The report also expressed concern that potential witnesses—seemingly many since a number of homes and a mosque overlook the crime scene—had been intimidated into silence.  The report, quoting retrieval team members, said the pit where many bodies were buried might have been dug several days before the massacre. The massacre occurred just 300 meters (1,000 feet) from a detachment of the Civilian Armed Forces, a local government militia. Members of the unit initially claimed to have seen no convoy, even though the vehicles were intercepted in a nearby spot that would have been clearly visible, the fact-finding report said. No single event has claimed as many journalists’ lives in the 18 years since CPJ began compiling detailed records. According to CPJ research, the deadliest prior event for the press came in Iraq on October 12, 2006, when 11 employees of Al-Shaabiya television were killed in an attack at the station’s Baghdad studios."},{"id":1808,"location":"Madagascar","year":"1994","name":"Victor Randrianirina","organization":"Malagasy national radio","date":"August 23, 1994","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Unknown","specificlocation":"Unknown","freelance":"No","description":"Randrianirina, a journalist with Malagasy National Radio, was attacked by unknown assailants on August 17.

The footage shows an armed individual approaching Fúnez and firing multiple shots as the journalist walks from his car to the entrance of his home in the La Gloria neighborhood.  Fúnez was hit at least twice by the bullets and died immediately, according to reports. The attacker is seen searching Fúnez’s pockets and removing something before fleeing on a motorcycle. The journalist’s wallet, ID and bank cards were found discarded on the ground three days later in a remote area of La Ceiba, according to reports. Less than six hours after the murder, police arrested Edwin Reniery Suazo Cruz, 23, seized the gun and motorcycle allegedly used in Fúnez’s murder, and charged him with aggravated robbery and murder. Police described Suazo to journalists as a hitman and local drug dealer. In a video circulated on social media later that afternoon, Suazo, alias “El Pájaro” (“The Bird”), is seen with blood on his head, appearing to confess to an officer that he killed Fúnez. The next day, as he was being taken to a preliminary hearing in the back of a pickup truck, Suazo told journalists he is innocent and said that police beat him and forced him to confess, according to news reports.On June 15, Security Minister Julián Pacheco Tinoco announced the creation of a special team to investigate the motive behind Fúnez’s murder. Deputy Commissioner César Mendoza, the chief of police in northern Honduras, told media the police are investigating two lines of inquiry, but did not provide any additional information.  Fúnez, known by his nickname, “El Masa,” hosted “Informe Nocturno,” a news program that aired from 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on 45TV, a local channel in La Ceiba, according to Tiempo Digital. A colleague from 45TV, who asked not to be named out of concern for his safety, told CPJ that Fúnez worked as a journalist for about two decades, beginning in radio before moving to television around 2009. Local reports described him as a widely beloved figure who was actively involved in the community, and hundreds of mourners filled the streets for his funeral. Honduran press freedom organization C-Libre reported that Fúnez received “almost daily” threats from unidentified persons. Fúnez’s colleague described one series of threats in April 2016, after Fúnez aired a video of security footage in which a woman is seen shooting a local bus driver.  Fúnez received multiple calls threatening him with violence or death if he continued reporting on the story, his colleague told CPJ.In addition to his work as a journalist, Fúnez was the governing National Party’s candidate to represent the Atlántida department in congressional elections slated for November 2017."},{"id":1810,"location":"India","year":"2010","name":"Vijay Pratap Singh","organization":"Indian express","date":"July 20, 2010","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Dangerous Assignment","specificlocation":"Allahabad","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Business, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Political Group","description":"Singh, 36, a senior correspondent for the daily Indian Express, died of injuries suffered in a July 12 bombing.

On November 10, 2012, two gunmen aboard a motorcycle killed Haidar Ali, the only remaining witness in the case, near his home in the Soldier Bazaar area of Karachi. He was due to testify in court two days later. The original prosecutors in the case--Muhammad Khan Buriro and Mobashir Mirza--told CPJ that they were threatened and eventually fired. They fled the country in late 2011. On March 3, 2014, more than three years after Babar was killed, a special Anti-Terrorism Court convicted six defendants for their roles in the murder. Judge Mushtaq Ahmed Leghari, who presided over the court, sentenced Naveed Polka, Muhammad Ali Rizvi, Faisal Mahmood, and Mohammad Shahrukh Khan to life in prison, news reports said. Two others, Kamran (alias \"Zeeshan\") and Faisal Mota, who remained at large, were given the death sentence in absentia. A seventh man, Mohammed Shakeel, was acquitted for lack of evidence, the reports said.In an alleged video confession posted on YouTube, Khan said he had been told to follow Babar as he was driving home from work, according to a Reuters report. He said Zeeshan had stepped in front of the journalist's car and shot him six to seven times. The video was authenticated to Reuters by the prosecutor, the report said.CPJ welcomed the convictions, the first in the murder of a Pakistani journalist, but has maintained that the masterminds are still at large.On August 16, 2017, the Sindh High Court agreed to rehear Faisal Mota's appeal against his death sentence, according to reports."},{"id":1841,"location":"Syria","year":"2013","name":"Walid Jamil Amira","organization":"Jobar media center","date":"March 3, 2013","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Crossfire","specificlocation":"Damascus","job":"Camera Operator, Photographer","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Human Rights, Politics, War","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Military Officials","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Amira\nwas killed by sniper fire while covering clashes near the Damascus suburb of\nAbaseen, according to Shaam News Network and the local press freedom group Syrian\nJournalists Association who confirmed the death via email.

Lasting a minute in length, the footage shows a first-person perspective of the cameraman running, before the force of an explosion throws the camera into the dirt. Audible groaning can be heard as the roar of a jet returns. Two more explosions follow, shaking the ground before the video ends. In another graphic video, severe lacerations in Aledel's back and right side can be seen. A description under the video, which was posted on the center's Facebook page, says the footage shows the journalist being taken to the morgue.\n\nMaarat Media Center and other opposition-affiliated media accused Russia of conducting the airstrike that killed Aledel. The official Syrian government outlet SANA claimed it was Syrian government jets that killed Aledel, whom SANA accused of being a \"terrorist.\"\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to CPJ's emailed request for comment in late October 2015. When CPJ called the Russian embassy in Washington, D.C., a man who did not identify himself said the claim that a Russian airstrike had killed Aledel was false. When asked which part of the story was false, the man said he had no comment and hung up.\n\nThe Russian military has not publicly disclosed any specific strikes in or near Binin on October 23. On October 26, the Russian Defense Ministry said on its website it had launched 164 combat sorties targeting 285 \"terrorist objects\" in the past three days across Syria, including in Idlib province.\n\nThe Russian military said it began airstrikes in Syria in September 2015 against Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, and other militant groups. Russia has come under criticism by Syrian rebels and their supporters for using the strikes as an excuse to target all rebels fighting the Assad government, a long-time strategic ally of Russia. Human rights and civil society groups have criticized the strikes for indiscriminately killing and even targeting civilians.\n\nIn a report citing \"battlefield sources\" SANA claimed Aledel was one of 13 Ahrar al-Sham members killed by Syrian airstrikes near Binin. Ahrar al-Sham, whose fighters have links to Al-Qaeda, is a leading member of the Jaish al-Fateh coalition that includes Al-Qaeda's official branch in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. At the time of Aledel's death, the coalition comprised one of the strongest fighting forces countering the Assad government and Islamic State.\n\nAledel's Twitter page featured a picture of many of Ahrar al-Sham's leaders who had been killed, and he memorialized on social media leaders of other rebel groups who have died. CPJ did not find any evidence that Aledel participated in fighting. A month before his death, Aledel posted a picture of himself raising a camera in the air and said it was the weapon he chose to support the revolution.\n\nAccording to news reports, Aledel defected from the Syrian army at the start of the uprising and began working in media. He first worked in the media office for the opposition coalition group, Syrian Revolution General Commission, filming fighting and other stories from his hometown of Maarat al-Numan and other parts of Idlib province. He later worked a freelancer for local and international outlets, including Al-Jazeera and Turkey's state-run outlet Anadolu Agency, who both reported his death.\n\nIn August 2015, he helped found the Maarat Media Center, a collective of journalists from his hometown. According to the center, the group reports independently from Maarat al-Numan and its environs in an attempt to unify opposition forces in the fight against the Assad government. In the weeks before Aledel's death, the center focused its reporting on what it called the \"Russian aggression,\" filming what it said were civilian casualties caused by Russian airstrikes.\n\nOn October 6, 2015 the group published a video of Aledel reporting on anti-Russian protests in Idlib and the silence of the international community. On October 12, 2015 Aledel was injured while covering fighting in Kfar Nabouda, north of the city of Hama. A video of Aledel slurring pro-opposition slogans under anesthetic as medical workers attended to a wound on his face went viral as numerous people wished him a fast recovery on social media."},{"id":1844,"location":"Bangladesh","year":"2015","name":"Washiqur Rahman Babu","organization":"Freelance","date":"March 30, 2015","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Dhaka","job":"Internet Reporter","medium":"Internet","coverage":"Culture, Human Rights, Politics","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"Yes","sourceoffire":"Political Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"Yes","description":"Three assailants attacked Rahman with a sharp weapon as he left his home to go to work in the morning, The Associated Press reported.

The journalists were found days after they had been abducted.\nThe building was hit by an airstrike on May 21, which was launched by a Saudi-led coalition of countries against Houthi militias in the city of Dhamar, news reports said.\nOn May 20, 2015, al-Ayzari and Qabil were kidnapped by militiamen allegedly affiliated with the Houthi movement and its allies, according to the journalists' employers and news reports. Yemen Youth TV, Suhail TV, and the journalists' families, who issued a statement to the press, said the two were returning to the city of Dhamar after covering a meeting by tribesmen opposed to the Houthis in the Al-Hada region, northeast of the city. The statements by Yemen Youth TV and the journalists' families said that the two journalists were in a car with a third man, Hussein al-Aysi, when they were stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Houthis. The families' statement also says the Houthi militiamen searched the journalists' car and confiscated their equipment before capturing and imprisoning them.\nQabil's body was recovered on May 25, and al-Ayzari's the next day, according to news reports. Dozens of other victims were also suspected to have been killed in the same air strike, the reports say. Al-Aysi was not killed in the air strike, news reports said. It is unclear what Al-Aysi's role was with Qabil and al-Ayzari.\nNews reports and a statement from the Yemeni Journalists Syndicate said the building that was hit in the air strike was an earthquake monitoring station. Belqees TV, Yemen Youth TV, and Suhail TV released statements blaming the Houthis for the deaths of the two reporters and alleging that the Houthis used the journalists as human shields to protect a military installation. After the strike, the head of the earthquake monitoring station told the media that there was no military value to the site, according to news reports.\nHouthi rebels took control of the capital, Sana'a, and other cities in September 2014, eventually forcing the government to resign, according to news reports. On March 25, a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of 10 countries began launching air strikes, targeting territory controlled by the Houthi militia, in an attempt to restore the exiled president who fled Yemen later that month as the Houthis increased their control over the country. Around the time that the air strikes began, outlets critical of the Houthis or affiliated with coalition governments were raided by Houthi forces and their staff temporarily detained, according to CPJ research.\nBoth al-Ayzari and Suhail TV were attacked by Houthi militiamen in prior months. According to Suhail TV, al-Ayzri was captured by the Houthis in early April. He was released on April 9 when the militiamen retreated from the area in which he was being held, according to the journalist's Facebook page. The offices of Suhail TV in Sana'a were raided in March by Houthi militia members, according to a statement by the outlet, and several staff members were taken hostage, according to CPJ research. According to news reports, the channel is closely linked to the Islah Party, a political opponent of the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has allied with the Houthi movement.\nThe Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen has resulted in a large number of civilian casualties. Saudi military officials, facing criticism, have accused Houthi forces of using human shields and fighting within civilian populations, according to news reports.\nAl-Masirah TV, the official news outlet of the Houthi movement, said the bombing in Dhamar resulted in a number of civilian casualties and the destruction of many buildings that had no military usage. The station did not mention the deaths of the two journalists.\nCPJ called the press office of the Saudi Embassy in Washington in May 2015, seeking comment on the journalists' death, and was told by an embassy spokeswoman to submit questions via email. CPJ emailed questions to the embassy on the same day, which included whether the building was targeted because it allegedly was a military installation and if the coalition was aware that there were journalists being held in the building.

Based on the circumstances and secrecy surrounding Shchekochikhin's death, and the dangerous subject he was investigating at the time, CPJ also believes there is sufficient reason for launching a murder probe. The Prosecutor General's Office has repeatedly denied Novaya Gazeta's requests to open a murder investigation into Shchekochikhin's death, citing lack of foul play evidence.\n\nShchekochikhin worked for Novaya Gazeta since 1996, covering dangerous assignments such as the Chechen conflict, high-powered corruption, arms trade, and organized crime. From 2001 until his sudden death in 2003, he had published a series of detailed investigative reports on a smuggling and corruption case that involved a Moscow furniture store known as Tri Kita (Three Whales). As a member of Russia's parliament, Shchekochikhin interviewed officials and gained access to documents related to the case.\n\nWhile the Tri Kita case seemed like a regular business fraud case- the store had smuggled European furniture without paying taxes and customs fees-it involved high-ranking FSB officials who were found to have used the furniture business to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the Bank of New York in the late '90s.\n\nIn a February 18, 2002, lengthy article for Novaya Gazeta, Shchekochikhin revealed evidence that the Prosecutor General's Office had received US$2 million in bribes in order to stop a Tri Kita corruption investigation.\n\nFollowing its publication, Shchekochikhin received threats but continued investigating. In March 2002, as deputy chairman of the State Duma Committee on Security, he helped launch a parliamentary probe into the Tri Kita case. The probe was rejected by then Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov who refused to re-open the Tri Kita case, citing lack of evidence of criminal activity.\n\nIn April 2002 Shchekochikhin wrote President Vladimir Putin to request he take the case under his personal control. President Putin responded positively, but as of June 2003 the case had gone nowhere. On June 2, 2003, Shchekochikhin published another detailed article on the Tri Kita affair-his last one. Exactly a month after the material appeared in Novaya Gazeta, Shchekochikhin was dead.\n\nThe June 2 piece criticized the corruption in Russia's law enforcement. The piece followed up the May 27, 2003, assassination of a key witness in the Tri Kita case. The witness, Sergei Pereverzev, then president of Russia's Furniture Business Association and a former navy captain, had received threats ahead of his court testimony and had publicly said he feared for his life, Shcheckochikhin wrote. On May 14, Pereverzev was injured in a car crash and taken to a Moscow military hospital. Thirteen days later, he was assassinated by a gunman who had somehow managed to penetrate the heavily guarded neurosurgical ward.\n\nExactly one month after the piece was published, Shchekochikhin was dead-victim of an \"unknown allergen\" that caused organs failure.\n\nOn June 17, 2003, while on a business trip in the city of Ryazan, 200 kilometers (120 miles) south-east of Moscow, Shchekochikhin suddenly felt sick with flu-like symptoms. He returned to Moscow that day with a fever, sore throat, body aches, and a burning sensation all over his skin, Novaya Gazeta reported. The next day, a doctor diagnosed him with an acute respiratory viral infection. But Shchekochikhin's health rapidly deteriorated in the next few days and he was hospitalized on June 21. In the next 12 days, the journalist's organs failed one by one-his skin literally peeled off his body; he lost all of his hair; his lungs, liver, kidneys, and, finally, his brain stopped functioning.\n\nDoctors said Shchekochikhin's symptoms were consistent with the Lyell's Syndrome-a severe allergic reaction to medications or infections, Novaya Gazeta said. But the allergen that caused the reaction was never identified. Moreover, Shchekochikhin's clinical test results were classified as \"medical secret.\" Moscow Central Clinical Hospital authorities have refused family and colleagues access to those.\n\nWithout clinical test results, the Prosecutor General's Office says there is no evidence of foul play and refuses to open a murder case into Shchekochikhin's death. Medical authorities, in turn, say they can only grant access to Shchekochikhin's file if prosecutors need to use it as evidence in a criminal investigation, according to a Novaya Gazeta article from January 15, 2007.\n\nA month before his death, Shchekochikhin had met with officials from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), and had obtained an American visa. He was to travel to the United States to discuss the Bank of New York, money-laundering, connection in the Tri Kita case, according to local and international press reports. He never made it to the States."},{"id":1885,"location":"Russia","year":"1994","name":"Yuri Soltis","organization":"Interfax","date":"June 12, 1994","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Murder","specificlocation":"Moscow","job":"Print Reporter","medium":"Print","coverage":"Corruption, Crime","gender":"Male","localorforeign":"Local","freelance":"No","sourceoffire":"Criminal Group","impunity":"Complete Impunity","captive":"No","tortured":"No","threatened":"No","description":"Soltis, a crime reporter for the independent news agency Interfax, was found beaten to death at a train station in the Stroitel district on the outskirts of Moscow.

CPJ could not confirm these claims.\nThe day Mtatwe'e died, the Zebdine Coordination Committee posted a photo of him on its Facebook page that showed him holding a gun with a caption calling him a \"mujahid\" hero and journalist.

Kazemi, a contributor to the Montreal-based magazine Recto Verso and the London-based photo agency Camera Press, was detained on June 23 while taking photographs of the families of detainees outside Tehran's Evin Prison. She was held for nearly two weeks before being transferred to the hospital in a coma.\n\nDuring subsequent weeks, officials tried to cover up the circumstances of Kazemi's death. Initially, Iranian officials maintained that the journalist had died of a stroke, and that she had complained of poor health while she was detained. On July 16, Iranian Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi announced that Kazemi had died from a \"brain hemorrhage resulting from beatings.\" Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi later backed away from the statement, saying the journalist may have died from an \"accident.\" A government inquiry released in late July 2003 concluded that Kazemi died as a result of a skull fracture likely caused by a blow to her head.\n\nAuthorities prevented an autopsy by burying Kazemi's body in Iran against the wishes of her family in Canada. The Canadian government responded by withdrawing its ambassador to Tehran. In the ensuing months, several agents from the Intelligence Ministry were arrested in connection with Kazemi's death.\n\nA parliamentary commission report released in November 2003 said that members of the Iranian judiciary had been holding Kazemi in custody when she was beaten, making it unlikely, according to journalists and reformist politicians, that those responsible for her death will be brought to justice.\n\nOn July 24, 2004, an Iranian court acquitted intelligence agent Mohamed Reza Aqdam Ahmadi of the \"semi-intentional murder\" of Kazemi. The court cited insufficient evidence.\n\nThe trial, which began on July 17, was abruptly ended the following day. Kazemi's legal team, headed by Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, accused the court of refusing to hear witness testimony and to consider evidence accusing another prison official of delivering the fatal blow that killed Kazemi.\n\nEbadi said she would appeal the verdict in Iranian courts, but that if justice is denied, they will have no choice but to take the case \"to international courts and the United Nations.\""},{"id":1896,"location":"Afghanistan","year":"2017","name":"Zainullah","organization":"Radio television afghanistan","date":"May 17, 2017","killed":"Killed","typeofdeath":"Jalalabad","coverage":"Male","gender":"Local","threatened":"Zainullah, the head of advertising at the state broadcaster Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA), died in May 17, 2017, sustained assault on the station’s office in Jalalabad, Aminullah Zaheer, RTA’s Nangarhar province director, told CPJ.
